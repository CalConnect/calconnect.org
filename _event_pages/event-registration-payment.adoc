== CalConnect Event Registration & Payment Options

The CalConnect Virtual Conference May 2022 will be  be four days
(Monday - Thursday May 09-12).  Each day is planned for three hours
although Friday will be flexible in terms of time and sessions.

In addition to a variety of sessions, we plan to arrange working
sessions on Monday and Thursday afternoons for testing opportunities and
for other joint efforts.

We will contact people after they register to determine if they are
interested in testing, and to agree in advance on testing areas, such as
testing of new components, testing and resolution of bugs and issues,
test requests from TCs to confirm application behavior.

The Virtual Conference is open to members and non-members.
