== Observers

_Current as of February 2019_

At CalConnect Conferences, observers are individuals from an
organization which is not a member of the CalConnect, attending to
determine whether involvement in CalConnect is valuable enough to their
organization to join. Generally, an organization can only attend one
CalConnect Conference as an Observer.


=== Information about Previous CalConnect Events

Information about each CalConnect Conference (and former
Interoperability Test Events) is published shortly after each event in
event reports posted to the CalConnect website. See
link:{{'/events/event-reports' | relative_url }}[Event Reports] for an index of these reports.
The reports cover what went on at the Conference, what the current
work is in the Technical Committees, and broadly what we expect to be
doing until the next event.

In the past, CalConnect separated its week into two segments:  an
Interoperability Test Event for the first 2.5 days, and a Conference for
the last 2.5 days.  Recently CalConnect has changed to a single 4-day
event comprising both Conference activities and work sessions, which can
include interoperability testing.

Several years ago, CalConnect published a newsletter called _CalConnect
Minutes_ after each event, containing much the same information. You can
find copies of the newsletters at link:{{'/minutes' | relative_url }}[CalConnect Minutes]. The
newsletter ceased publication in 2012.

=== Observers at a CalConnect Conference

Attendance and participation at a CalConnect Conference is generally
limited to representatives of members of CalConnect. However, a
non-member interested in joining CalConnect may register one or more
representatives to attend *a single Conference* on its
behalf as observers.

Conference observers pay the same registration fee as member
representatives and are welcome to participate in all CalConnect
activities at the Conference, but will not be able to vote, nor to
continue involvement after the Conference unless their organization
joins CalConnect.

Conference Observers are required to abide by the relevant clauses of
the
link:{{'/membership/membership-agreement' | relative_url }}[Membership Agreement]
and member
representative link:{{'/membership/code-conduct' | relative_url }}[Code of Conduct] while attending the
Conference and with respect to any actions resulting from the Conference
in the future. The individual registering for the Conference as an
observer must acknowledge that he or she, and any other individuals
being registered at the same time, have read the terms and conditions
indicated above and agrees to abide by them.
