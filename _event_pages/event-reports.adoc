== General

NOTE: As of CalConnect XLIII (September 2018) separate conferences and test
events/developers forums were discontinued and a single multi-day event covering
sessions of all types was instituted. Therefore there will be no Test
Event/Developers Forum reports after CalConnect XLII, and the "CalConnect
Conference" report will cover all activities at the event.

== CALSCH Interoperability Testing

Prior to the formation of CalConnect, the CALSCH Working Group of the IETF
sponsored three interoperability testing events between April 2000 and September
2002.

Please see link:{{'/interop' | relative_url}}[CALSCH IOP Tests] for information about those events.
