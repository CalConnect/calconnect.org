== About CalConnect Events

_Current as of February 2019_

CalConnect holds three regular CalConnect Conferences each year. These
events are generally held the first full week of February, June, and
October, but may be shifted a week or two either way at the convenience
of the host or to avoid collision with other events of importance to
CalConnect members.

CalConnect Conferences are four days, generally either Monday-Thursday
of a week, or Tuesday-Friday of a week.

Occasionally a separate event such as a Codefest or Workshop might be
scheduled in the free Monday or Friday of a CalConnect week if
acceptable to the host; these are usually public events and may not
require a fee (or provide any catering services).

CalConnect may also hold special events such as Workshops or "Meet
CalConnect" invitational events completely separate from its regularly
scheduled CalConnect Events when necessary.

In the past, CalConnect held separate Interoperabiity Test Events,
either in a single week divided between the test event and the
conference, or as a completely separeate event; testing is now
incorporated into the regular CalConnect Conferences and is generally
not a separate event.

A non-member may be an link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url }}[Observer] at

links will be posted.
