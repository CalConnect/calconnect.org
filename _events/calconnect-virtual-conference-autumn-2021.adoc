*Introduction*

The CalConnect Virtual Conference 2021 will be held via Zoom the week of April 12-16, 2021. Our goal is to present a set of compelling sessions on issues CalConnect members are currently facing and possibly working on.

The conference will be conducted on the North America Eastern time zone (UTC-5) and will take place Monday through Wednesday from 11:00 to 14:00 EST. Thursday and possibly Friday, which will have sessions at times convenient for our Far East and Australia colleages presenting the sessions, will be from 01:00 to 04:00 EST (this schedule may be adjusted as needed).

The conference will be organized by day with each day having a list of sessions and session topics. At this time we are not going to assign a specific time for each session within the 3-hour period, however we expect that most sessions will be no more than an hour including a question or discussion period and a short break. Insofar as possible sessions will be scheduled to begin on the top of the hour. All sessions will be recorded and available after the fact to registrants who were unable to be on a specific session.

We also plan to offer interoperability testing during or adjacent to the Virtual Conference. More details on this will be available when people register.

The Virtual Conferences will be open to members and non-members. You must register in advance and pay the registration fee for the conference prior to Monday April 12 2021. Please register for the conference at link:{{'/events/event-registration-payment' | relative_url }}[Event Registration]

Registration for the Virtual Conference is $50 U.S. per person.
