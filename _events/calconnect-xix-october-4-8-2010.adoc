Recent Changes:

*Information is current through September 17, 2010* +
_Exchanged FREEBUSY and USECASE Sessions_

CalConnect XIX, consisting of CalConnect Interoperability Test Event, and a CalConnect Roundtable (Members Meeting), will be held in Littleton, Massachusetts on Monday-Friday, October 4-8, 2010, hosted by http://www.ibm.com[IBM/Lotus].

The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday October 4-5, and Wednesday morning October 6, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 6th, and last through early afternoon Friday the 8th. An optional __Introductory Q & A about CalConnect__, intended for first-time attendees, will be scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 5th if we have first-time attendees.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: At this meeting, we will host a regular CalConnect Interoperability Test Event. While we will not host a formal Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event, if participants wish to test mobile applications or devices they are welcome to do so and we will help to establish testing pairs.

The IOP Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as http://calconnect.org/observer.shtml[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop1010.shtml[Interoperability Test Event October 2010] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Roundtable XIX:* The Roundtable Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and http://calconnect.org/observer.shtml[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

Attendees who require a Letter of Invitation to obtain a visa should contact Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director, at mailto:dave.thewlis@calconnect.org[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org]. Please be aware that you must have registered for the event before a Letter of Invitation can be issued.

[[registration]]

Please see http://calconnect.org/regtypes.shtml[Registration and Payment Options] to choose your registration type and payment option for the Roundtable and/or the CalConnect Interoperability Test Events.

[[location]]
Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place at the IBM/Lotus campus at 550 King Street, Littleton, Massachusetts. We will be in the All Hands Room on the first floor for the entire week. (The User Special Interest Group on Wednesday morning will be in a separate conference room to be assigned closer to the event.) For a map of the area showing the venue location and conference hotels please see http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105447925503204780687.00048c79498f5b8f9ccd2&ll=42.560225,-71.456881&spn=0.04672,0.132093&z=14[IBM/Lotus Littleton MA, and surrounding area].

*Parking:* If you are driving, you may park in one of the visitor spots near the front door, or anywhere in the regular partling areas; there are no dedicated or reserved parking areas.

*Hotel Shuttles and Walking:* The hotels do not have shuttles, and are a bit more than 2 miles from the IBM building. This means that walking is doable but a bit more than people may want to undertake. Carpooling with those who have autos is probably the best alternative.

[[transportation]]
Transportation

*Airport Information:* Littleton is served by both Boston's http://www.massport.com/logan/[Boston Logan International Airport], and by Manchester, New Hampshire's http://calconnect.org/www.flymanchester.com[Manchester Boston Regional Airport], and is approximately 30 miles from either. Logan will have more flights and possibly better fares, but it is a bit more complicated to get to and from the airport and may require more time.

*Ground Transportation:* Some information on rental cars, shuttles, and public transportation is available from the airport websites. http://www.harrislimousines.com/home/[Harris Limosines] and http://www.flightlineinc.com/[Flightline Inc.] provide service from and to both airports for about $65 for Logan and $55 for Manchester one way; reservations are required. Taxi fare is approximately $75 from either airport.

From Boston you can also take the MBTA commuter rail Fitchburg line, which has a stop in Littleton about 2.5 miles from IBM and about 5 miles from the hotels. See http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/stations/?stopId=105[].
