Recent Changes:

*Information is current to January 27, 2012* +
_Location of USIG meeting Wednesday Morning identified_

CalConnect XXIII, consisting of CalConnect Interoperability Test Events, and a CalConnect Roundtable Technical Conference (Members Meeting), will be held in Cupertino, California Monday-Friday, January 30 - February 3, 2012, hosted by http://www.apple.com[Apple Inc.].

The Interoperability Test Events will take place all day Monday and Tuesday January 30-31, and Wednesday morning February 1, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 1st, and last through early afternoon Friday the 3rd. An optional __Introductory Q & A about CalConnect__, intended for first-time attendees, will be scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 1st if we have first-time attendees.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Events*: At this meeting, we will host a combined regular CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and a Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event. A participating organization may register for either or both events for a single registration fee, but should be aware that they may require additional individuals to participate in both activities.

The IOP Test Events are open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see link:{{'/iop1201' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event January-February 2012] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Roundtable XXIII:* The Roundtable Technical ConferenceMembers Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

International Visitors

International visitors who are not U.S. Citizens or hold a valid U.S. passport should acquaint themselves with any changes in U.S. travel and visitor policy since their last visit to the U.S. at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/[]. Attendees who require a Letter of Invitation to obtain a visa should contact Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director, at mailto:dave.thewlis@calconnect.org[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org]. Please be aware that you must have registered for the event before a Letter of Invitation can be issued.

San Francisco is the most practical airport for international arrivals and departures although the other two offer some international service.

[[registration]]
== Registration Information

Please see link:{{'/events/event-registration-payment' | relative_url}}[Registration and Payment Options] to choose your registration type and payment option for the Roundtable and/or the CalConnect Interoperability Test Events. Note that you must register separately for the Roundtable and for the Test Events. You may register at any time for the next events.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place at Apple headquarters, One Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. Monday morning only we will be in the *Launch* conference room on the first floor of building *Infinite Loop 2 (IL2/1)*. Starting Monday lunch and for the rest of the week we will be in the *Garage 1* conference room on the second floor of building *Infinite Loop 4 (IL4/2)*. Please see http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105447925503204780687.00046f4f71cfaca40aa04&ll=37.327922,-122.031155&spn=0.02457,0.037122&z=15[Apple Campus and surrounding area] for a map of the Apple Headquarters campus and surrounding area. Zooming in on the map will show you the location of the separate Infinite Loop buildings.

*Parking:* Parking is available in any of the parking areas within Infinite Loop itself.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* The San Francisco Bay Area is served by three airports: http://www.flysfo.com/default.asp[San Francisco International (SFO)], https://www.oaklandairport.com/[Oakland International (OAK)], and http://www.sjc.org/[San Jose Mineta Airport (SJC)].

Cupertino is about 30 miles south of San Francisco International Airport, and quite close to San Jose International Airport. Oakland International is on the east side of San Francisco Bay and much less convenient to the South Bay area. SFO has the most flights and airlines serving it, but you might be able to find less expensive fares via SJC or OAK.

*Ground Transportation:* Information on rental cars and shuttles is available on all three airport websites. Two of the hotels listed below (Cypress Hotel and Cupertino Inn) are within walking distance of the Apple campus, so it would be psosible to avoid having a rental car if you use a shuttle service or other public transportation to and from the airport; alternatively you may be able to arrange rides between your hotel and the Apple campus with other conference attendees.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

We are not designating a "Conference Hotel" for this meeting as we have not been able to establish special rates. There are many hotels in the area, however The Cypress Hotel and the Cupertino Inn are the closest to the Apple Campus and within walking distance. The Cypress Hotel is currently offering a rather high rate unless you book for seven days or more; it might be worth it to do that and try to truncate your visit. There does not appear to be any significant savings using the Apple rate but you are welcome to request it of either the Cypress or the Cupertino Inn. The Wild Palms hotel is a bit further (about 2 miles from Apple) and offers a somewhat lower rate; it is a member of Joie de Vivre, a well-thought-of California hotel chain. +

[[bofs]]
==== Scheduled BOFs

[[bof1]] The BOF will discuss the problems with replacement as an update mechanism and how various solutions are being developed to avoid these issues. The problem areas to be covered will include update of attachments in CalDAV and attendee participation status changes.

[[bof2]] This BOF will discuss various ways to improve the current process for auto-discovery of server and automatic account provisioning. We will discuss the current standards approach of SRV records + .well-known resource, and look at an alternative pure HTTP solution using the webfinger proposal.

Requests for BOF sessions can be made at the Wednesday opening and known BOFs will be scheduled at that time. However spontaneous BOF sessions are welcome to be called at BOF session time during the Roundtable.
