a| *CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*:

The Interoperability Test Events are open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see link:{{'/iopnextalias.html' | relative_url}}[Next CalConnect Interoperability Test Event] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

_Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the Interoperability testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._

*CalConnect Conference XXXI:* The CalConnect Conference will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

*Special Events*: Two workshops will be held during the conference on Thursday and Friday mornings at 0830-1000, on History and Comment Feeds in iCalendar and on Groups Sharing and Scheduling respectively; see link:{{'/calconnect31#workshops' | relative_url}}[Workshops]. Additional, a demo will be held during the TC FREEBUSY session on Thursday at 1100-1200 of *inter-system consensus scheduling*. The demo will feature multiple clients running on different servers (and implementations) performing consensus scheduling, based on VPOLL, iSCHEDULE, and jCAL.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Conference will take place in the Castle Room at http://www.thehigginsbedford.org.uk[The Higgins Art Gallery and Museum], Castle Lane, Bedford, United Kingdom. The venue is a few minutes walk of the conference hotel. See http://calconnect31.youcanbookme.com/venue.html for a view of The Higgins and a map of the central Bedford area.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* The most convenient airport to Bedford is http://www.london-luton.co.uk/[London Luton Airport]. London Luton serves European and U.K. destinations, and is recommended for European travelers arriving by air.

For those arriving from more distant locations, you would probably fly into either http://www.heathrowairport.com/[London Heathrow] or http://www.gatwickairport.com/[London Gatwick]. While either will work, London Gatwick is somewhat more convenient in terms of ground transportation to Bedford.

*Ground Transportation:*

*Rental Cars and Taxis:* All three airports have rental car facilities and taxis available.

*From London Luton:* Direct public transportation is available from London Luton via train and bus.

*From London Gatwick:* You can take the First Capitol Connect train directly to Bedford from London Gatwick via St. Pancras International station.

*From London Heathrow:* There is no direct train service from Heathrow. If you wish public transportation take the London Express to Paddington Station, transfer to St. Pancras Station, and take the train north to Bedford.

*Additional Information:* Our hosts have provided a page on transportation alternatives with more detailed information; see http://calconnect31.youcanbookme.com/transport.html[]. They are also willing to help arrange shared rides for those arriving at compatible times, a link is available from the page to provide them your arrival information. If a shared ride cannot be arranged, we will inform you in time to make other arrangements.

*Returning from Bedford:* We will attempt to arrange shared transport back to the major departure locations after the event and will poll everyone during the week to identify departure information and sharing possibilities.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

The conference hotel for this event is the Bedford Swan, The Embankment, Bedford. There is no guaranteed room rate, so you may book directly via their website at http://www.bedfordswanhotel.co.uk/[]. If you wish to stay at the conference hotel we recommend booking as soon as possible; rates will undoubtedly rise closer to the event. (The hotel cancellation policy is 4 p.m. date of arrival.) The Swan is about a 5 minute walk from the conference venue.

*Alternative Accommodation:* If the Swan is not available or you prefer an alternative, our hosts have provided information about several hotels and B&Bs: http://calconnect31.youcanbookme.com/accommodation.html[]. All offer free Wifi. Be sure you book a room with breakfast or plan to otherwise have breakfast before you arrive at The Higgins each morning as we are not serving breakfast at the event.

[[test-schedule]]
== Test Event Schedule

The Interoperability Test Event begins at 0830 Monday morning and runs all day Monday and Tuesday, plus Wednesday morning. The Conference begins with lunch on Wednesday and runs through Friday afternoon.

Please note: The Conference Schedule below is provisional. Once Topical Agendas are finalized we may need to make changes in session lengths and schedule location.

_Please note: In accordance with our custom for European meetings we will not offer breakfast other than coffee service and rolls, as breakfast is generally part of your hotel booking._

[[workshops]]
==== Workshops and BOFs

*Workshop: History and Comments feeds in iCalendar* Thursday 0830-1000:

In shared calendar environments, in particular, it is useful to know who changed an event or task, when the change was made, and what those changes were. Whilst a sophisticated "versioning" system could cover that, a lightweight approach may be better. In addition, users often want to be able to comment publicly or privately on an event or task, generating a "stream" of comments that can be reviewed (rather than just having the last comment visible as is typically the case today).

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss each of these issues in more depth with the goal of determining possible solutions to these problems. Consideration will be made for scaleability, useability, and the desire not to reinvent the wheel wherever possible.

*Workshop: Groups Sharing and Scheduling* Friday 0830-1000:

Much of the focus of scheduling and sharing of calendar data has been for use by "individuals". However, in many "enterprise" and "social" environments, individuals often have a common "purpose" that can be represented by placing those related individuals into a "group". When groups exist, it would be convenient to be able to schedule or share data with all members of the group, and have changes to the group membership over time impact the scheduling and sharing states.

For example, a company might setup a group for a specific project that a number of individuals are working one. A team meeting for project members is scheduled every week. When a new team member arrives, they are added to the group. At that point it would be convenient if they were also automatically added as an attendee of the weekly team meeting. Similarly, if an individual is no longer associated with the project and removed from the group, they should be automatically removed as an attendee of the team meeting.

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss how automatic management of group attendees and group sharees could be achieved on a CalDAV server and, in more general terms, via iTIP. We will examine different use cases, or "modes", of group scheduling and sharing with a view to addressing concerns of scaleability in particular.
