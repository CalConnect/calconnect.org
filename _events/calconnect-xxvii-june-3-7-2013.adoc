_Meeting Rooms at Union South building confirmed_

CalConnect XXVII, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and a CalConnect Roundtable Technical Conference (Members Meeting), will be held in Madison, Wisconsin Monday-Friday, June 3-7, 2013, hosted by http://www.wisc.edu[The University of Wisconsin]. +
 +
 The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday June 3-4, and Wednesday morning June 5, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday June 5, and last through early afternoon Friday June 7. +
 +
 An informal __Introductory Q & A about CalConnect__, intended for first-time attendees, will be scheduled at 09:30 on Wednesday the 5th for first-time attendees. +
 +
 A special *BOF on Calendar Sharing and Notifications* will be held Wednesday morning at 10:30-12:30.afternoon during the Roundtable open to all participants at the Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: The Interoperability Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as http://calconnect.org/observer.shtml[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop1306.shtml[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event June 2013] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available. +
 +
_Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._ +
 +
*Roundtable XXVII:* The Roundtable Technical Conference and Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and http://calconnect.org/observer.shtml[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. +

International Visitors

International visitors who are not U.S. Citizens or hold a valid U.S. passport should acquaint themselves with any changes in U.S. travel and visitor policy since their last visit to the U.S. at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/[]. Attendees who require a Letter of Invitation to obtain a visa should contact Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director, at mailto:dave.thewlis@calconnect.org[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org]. Please be aware that you must have registered for the event before a Letter of Invitation can be issued. +
 +
 Dane County Regional Airport does not offer international service, so international travelers will have to clear customs and immigration at a transit point, such as Chicago O'Hare.

[[registration]]
== Registration Information

Please see http://calconnect.org/regtypes.shtml[Registration and Payment Options] to choose your registration type and payment option for the Roundtable and/or the CalConnect Interoperability Test Events. Note that you must register separately for the Roundtable and for the Test Events. You may register at any time for the next events.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place at the Union South building, 1308 West Dayton Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53706. We will be in the *Industry* Room Monday through Thursday 3-6 June, and the *Northwoods* Room on Friday 7 June. +
 +
 The Union South building is within walking distance of the conference hotel, so you will not need an automobile. +
 +
 This map shows the location of the Doubletree Hotel, the Union South Building, and other points of interest: https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zAsY2cEyHcf8.k3ZOyuvNadNU/

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* Madison is served by http://www.msnairport.com[Dane County Regional Airport], which is less than ten miles from the University. This is a regional airport and most travelers will have to route though a larger airport. You may also fly to O'Hare International Airport (Chicago) and drive, but it is at least a three hour drive from the airport to Madison. +
 +
*Ground Transportation:* Taxi fare between the airport and the conference hotel is approximately $20 and takes about 15 minutes. The hotel also offers a shuttle service between 7:00 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. - call the hotel at 1-608-251-5511 when you land to arrange pickup. A public metro bus is also available. See http://www.msnairport.com/guide/ground_transport.aspx[]. +
 +
 Major rental car companies are available onsite at Dane County Airport; see http://www.msnairport.com/guide/car_rentals.aspx[]. However, due to the closeness of the conference hotel and the meeting site, and the lack of available parking at the meeting site, we recommend that you not bother with a rental car at all unless you have special circumstances.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

We have arranged a block of rooms at a special conference rate at the http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/wisconsin/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-madison-MSNDTDT/index.html[Doubletree Madison] hotel, 525 West Johnson Street, Madison. The hotel is approximately eight blocks from the Union South building. +
 +
 The conference rate is $149 plus taxes per night and is inclusive of free internet access. You may reserve online or contact them at +1 800-222-8733 +1 608-251-5511 to make your reservation. *Be sure to enter or ask for the group rate CAL to get this rate.* +
 +
*Note Well:* The room block will be released on May 13. After that date rooms may still be available but this special rate will no longer be available. +
 +
 Several other hotels are available in the area if you are unable to stay at the Doubletree but we encourage you to stay at the conference hotel.
