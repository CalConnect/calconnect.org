_Meeting Rooms at Union South building confirmed_

CalConnect XXVII, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and a CalConnect Roundtable Technical Conference (Members Meeting), will be held in Madison, Wisconsin Monday-Friday, June 3-7, 2013, hosted by http://www.wisc.edu[The University of Wisconsin].

The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday June 3-4, and Wednesday morning June 5, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday June 5, and last through early afternoon Friday June 7.

An informal __Introductory Q & A about CalConnect__, intended for first-time attendees, will be scheduled at 09:30 on Wednesday the 5th for first-time attendees.

A special *BOF on Calendar Sharing and Notifications* will be held Wednesday morning at 10:30-12:30.afternoon during the Roundtable open to all participants at the Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: The Interoperability Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see link:{{'/iop1306' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event June 2013] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

_Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._

*Roundtable XXVII:* The Roundtable Technical Conference and Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

International Visitors

International visitors who are not U.S. Citizens or hold a valid U.S. passport should acquaint themselves with any changes in U.S. travel and visitor policy since their last visit to the U.S. at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/[]. Attendees who require a Letter of Invitation to obtain a visa should contact Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director, at mailto:dave.thewlis@calconnect.org[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org]. Please be aware that you must have registered for the event before a Letter of Invitation can be issued.

Dane County Regional Airport does not offer international service, so international travelers will have to clear customs and immigration at a transit point, such as Chicago O'Hare.

[[registration]]
== Registration Information

Please see link:{{'/events/event-registration-payment' | relative_url}}[Registration and Payment Options] to choose your registration type and payment option for the Roundtable and/or the CalConnect Interoperability Test Events. Note that you must register separately for the Roundtable and for the Test Events. You may register at any time for the next events.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place at the Union South building, 1308 West Dayton Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53706. We will be in the *Industry* Room Monday through Thursday 3-6 June, and the *Northwoods* Room on Friday 7 June.

The Union South building is within walking distance of the conference hotel, so you will not need an automobile.

This map shows the location of the Doubletree Hotel, the Union South Building, and other points of interest: https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zAsY2cEyHcf8.k3ZOyuvNadNU/

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* Madison is served by http://www.msnairport.com[Dane County Regional Airport], which is less than ten miles from the University. This is a regional airport and most travelers will have to route though a larger airport. You may also fly to O'Hare International Airport (Chicago) and drive, but it is at least a three hour drive from the airport to Madison.

*Ground Transportation:* Taxi fare between the airport and the conference hotel is approximately $20 and takes about 15 minutes. The hotel also offers a shuttle service between 7:00 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. - call the hotel at 1-608-251-5511 when you land to arrange pickup. A public metro bus is also available. See http://www.msnairport.com/guide/ground_transport.aspx[].

Major rental car companies are available onsite at Dane County Airport; see http://www.msnairport.com/guide/car_rentals.aspx[]. However, due to the closeness of the conference hotel and the meeting site, and the lack of available parking at the meeting site, we recommend that you not bother with a rental car at all unless you have special circumstances.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

We have arranged a block of rooms at a special conference rate at the http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/wisconsin/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-madison-MSNDTDT/index.html[Doubletree Madison] hotel, 525 West Johnson Street, Madison. The hotel is approximately eight blocks from the Union South building.

The conference rate is $149 plus taxes per night and is inclusive of free internet access. You may reserve online or contact them at +1 800-222-8733 +1 608-251-5511 to make your reservation. *Be sure to enter or ask for the group rate CAL to get this rate.*

*Note Well:* The room block will be released on May 13. After that date rooms may still be available but this special rate will no longer be available.

Several other hotels are available in the area if you are unable to stay at the Doubletree but we encourage you to stay at the conference hotel.
