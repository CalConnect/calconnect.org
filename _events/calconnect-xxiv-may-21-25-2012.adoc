_TC CALDAV and TC ISCHEDULE Sessions Swapped_

CalConnect XXIV, consisting of CalConnect Interoperability Test Events, and a CalConnect Roundtable Technical Conference (Members Meeting), will be held in Chattanooga, Tennessee Monday-Friday, May 21-25, 2012, hosted by http://www.egenconsulting.com[Patricia Egen Consulting].

The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday May 21-22, and Wednesday morning May 23, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 23rd, and last through early afternoon Friday the 25th. An optional __Introductory Q & A about CalConnect__, intended for first-time attendees, will be scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 23rd if we have first-time attendees.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: At this meeting, we will host a combined regular CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event. A participating organization may register for either or both events for a single registration fee, but should be aware that they may require additional individuals to participate in both activities.

The IOP Test Events are open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see link:{{'/iop1205' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event May 2012] for current information and a list of what WILL be tested at this event, plus other things that MAY be tested if there is sufficient interest. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Roundtable XXIV:* The Roundtable Technical Conference / Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

International Visitors

International visitors who are not U.S. Citizens or hold a valid U.S. passport should acquaint themselves with any changes in U.S. travel and visitor policy since their last visit to the U.S. at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/[]. Attendees who require a Letter of Invitation to obtain a visa should contact Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director, at mailto:dave.thewlis@calconnect.org[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org]. Please be aware that you must have registered for the event before a Letter of Invitation can be issued.

Chattanooga is is not an international airport and you will need to clear customs at your arrival airport in the United States prior to journeying on to Chattanooga.

[[registration]]
== Registration Information

Please see link:{{'/events/event-registration-payment' | relative_url}}[Registration and Payment Options] to choose your registration type and payment option for the Roundtable and/or the CalConnect Interoperability Test Event. Note that you must register separately for the Roundtable and for the Test Events. You may register at any time for the next events.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place in BALLROOM C at the Chattanooga Doubletree Hotel, 407 Chestnut Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402. The Doubletree will be the conference hotel.

*Parking:* Valet and self parking are available for $12 or $8 per day respectively. However as all functions will be at or close to the hotel you should not need an automobile at all.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* Chattanooga is served by http://www.chattairport.com[Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport]. The airport is less than 10 miles from downtown and the conference hotel, and is served by several airlines. See http://www.chattairport.com/www/docs/6.274/chattanooga-airport-destinations.html[Chattanooga Airport Destinations] for current service from Chattanooga (and by inference, to Chattanooga).

It may be more convenient for you to fly into Atlanta or Nashville than directly to Chattanooga (although Delta does fly between Atlanta and Chattanooga). There is an hourly shuttle between the Atlanta or Nashville airports and the Chattanooga Airport which takes about two hours; see htp://www.groometransportation.com[Groome Transportation]. The fare is less than $100 round trip.

*Ground Transportation:* Information on rental cars, taxis and shuttles available at the Chattanooga airport may be found at http://www.chattairport.com/www/docs/6.28/ground-transportation-car-rental.html[Ground Transportation].

Our hosts have also indicated they would be willing to provide transportation from the airport with advance notice. If you wish to take advantage of this please e-mail Patricia Egen directly with your arrival date, time, and airline, so they can consolidate trips as much as possible. We will sort out return trips to the airport during CalConnect week.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

The Chattanooga Doubletree is our conference hotel; all meeting functions and the Wednesday Reception, will take place at the Doubltree. We strongly encourage you to stay at the Doubletree. They are offering a special rate of $129 per night (plus taxes and fees) for CalConnect participants who book **prior to May 3, 2012**, so long as the room block is not exhaused. After that the discounted rate may not be available. The hotel has free Wifi in all rooms and throughout the public areas.

A variety of other hotels are within a few blocks of the Doubletree for those who may not be able to stay at the Doubletree.
