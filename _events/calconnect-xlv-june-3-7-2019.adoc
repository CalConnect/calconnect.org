If you are unsure, the following link provides detailed information for visitors to the United Kingdom: https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa[].

HOWEVER the situation with the U.K. regarding international travel is currently fluid due to the possibility of "Brexit" which may take place prior to our event.
