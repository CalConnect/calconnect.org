CalConnect XVII, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event, and a CalConnect Roundtable (Members Meeting), will be held in Irvine, California, on Monday-Friday, February 1-5, 2010, hosted by http://www.uci.edu[The University of California at Irvine].

The IOP Testing will take place all day Monday and Tuesday February 1-2, and Wednesday morning February 3, ending at noon on Wednesday. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 3rd, and last through early afternoon Friday the 5th. An optional Introductory Q & A about CalConnect, intended for first-time attendees, is scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 3rd.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Events*: At this meeting, we will host a regular CalConnect Interoperability Test Event. The IOP Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop1002.shtml[IOP Test Event February 2010] for current information. Check back often as these will be updated as more information becomes available.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Roundtable XVII:* The Roundtable Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place at the University of California in Irvine, California. We will be in Bren Hall, next to the University Club, for the entire week; however the rooms will change. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning the IOP Test Event will take place in Room 2222 of Bren Hall. The Roundtable will begin with lunch on Wednesday in Room 4011 of Bren Hall, and will be there the remainder of Wednesday and all day Thursday. On Friday, the Roundtable will move to Room 2011 of Bren Hall. For a general map of the area showing the venue locations and conference hotels please see http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105447925503204780687.000479ebabcfd2338e558&z=14[University of California at Irvine area]. Bren Hall is Building #314 on this map: http://www.parking.uci.edu/templates/campusmap/images/submap_engineering.jpg[].

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Parking:* If you are driving, Parking for Bren Hall will be in the Anteater Parking Structure at Peltason & Anteater; permits are required in the structure, and may be purchased at the kiosk on the structure's north entrance. See http://www.parking.uci.edu/templates/campusmap/images/submap_engineering.jpg[]. The Anteater Parking Structure is the building labeled "APS". Enter at the blue star on the north end, which marks the kiosk: http://www.parking.uci.edu/permits/visitorpermits.cfm[]. As noted above, Bren Hall is building #314.

*Hotel/UCI Shuttle:* The Ayres Hotel has arranged to offer us shuttle service to and from UC Irvine each day. Specific times for shuttle service will be announced to participants prior to the event. The dropoff/pickup point at UC Irvine will be at the University Club Parking lot, very close to Bren Hall. The parking lot is marked #18B on this map: http://www.parking.uci.edu/templates/campusmap/images/submap_engineering.jpg[]. Bren Hall, the meeting venue, is #314.

*Airport Information:* The closest airport is http://www.ocair.com/[John Wayne Airport], only a few miles from the hotels and the UC Irvine Campus. The next-nearest airport is http://www.longbeach.gov/airport/[Long Beach Airport], which is about 40 miles from UC Irvine and is served by relatively few airlines.

*Ground Transportation:* Both hotels referenced below offer a free shuttle to and from the John Wayne Airport; call the hotel to request a pickup. Information on rental cars and other shuttle options is available at both airport websites.

*Considerations for international arrival and departure:* The nearest airport, John Wayne Airport (SNA), is not an international airport and you cannot clear customs there upon arrival. We recommend connecting through another U.S. airport to clear customs, and then continuing on to John Wayne Airport. You can also fly directly into Los Angeles International -- however it is about 45 miles from LAX to UC Irvine by car or shuttle, which can take up to 90 minutes depending on traffic. (This may be particularly an issue on Friday afternoon departure.)

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

The University of California at Irvine has arranged for a special CalConnect rate with two local hotels, the Ayres Hotel & Suites, and the Atrium Hotel. Both hotels are very near the John Wayne Airport and within a few miles of the UCI campus. Both offer a shuttle from and to the airport and some form of shuttle service to local businesses within a few miles.

We have chosen the Ayres Hotel & Suites Costa Mesa / Newport Beach as our conference hotel. The Ayres is offering a special CalConnect rate of $79/night for the nights of January 31 through February 5. (A Junior Suite is also available at $99/night.)

Please note that you must have booked your room and guaranteed with a credit card by January 15 2010 to ensure you receive the special room rate. The room block is limited, so book early. _The CalConnect Rate will be available for booking as of Monday, December 7, 2009_. +

 \*We hope to arrange scheduled shuttle runs to and from the Ayres Hotel and the UCI Campus in the morning and evening. All registered participants will be asked prior to the event if they plan to use the shuttle so we can tell the hotel how many people to expect.

If you have a preferred hotel chain or your company does, the usual hotel chains have hotels in the area; these hotels are mostly clustered more or less in the vicinity of the airport. There are no hotels within comfortable walking distance of the UCI campus.
