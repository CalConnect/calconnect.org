More information on change of venue for Thursday only to Yahoo Main Campus

CalConnect XIII, consisting of both a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event, followed by a CalConnect Roundtable (Members Meeting), will be held in Santa Clara, California, Monday-Friday, October 6-10, 2008, hosted by http://info.yahoo.com[Yahoo/Zimbra]

The IOP Testing will take place all day Monday and Tuesday, and Wednesday morning, ending at noon on Wednesday. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 8th, and last through early afternoon Friday the 10th. An optional Introductory Q & A about CalConnect is scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 8th.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: The IOP Test Event event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see link:{{'/iop0810' | relative_url}}[IOP Test Event October 2008] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as we get nearer to the event.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

_*Please Note:* This is a regular IOP test event focused on calendaring servers and desktop clients. Please see link:{{'/miop0811' | relative_url}}[Mobile IOP Test Event November 4-6 2008] for more information about the next Mobile IOP Test Event._

*Roundtable XIII:* The Roundtable Members Meeting will as usual offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. A Technical Preview of current work is also planned; see below.

Friday morning will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, possibly demonstrations resulting from the IOP testing earlier in the week, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* The San Francisco Bay Area is served by three airports: http://www.sjc.org/[San Jose Mineta Airport (SJC)], http://www.flysfo.com/default.asp[San Francisco International (SFO)], and http://www.flyoakland.com/[Oakland International (OAK)].

Santa Clara is approximately eight miles from the San Jose Airport, and approximately 30 miles from San Francisco International. Oakland International is on the east side of the Bay and less convenient. SFO has the most flights and airlines serving it, but you may be able to find less expensive fares via SJC or OAK.

*Ground Transportation:* Information on rental cars and shuttles are available on all three airport websites.
