Recent Changes:

*Information is current through May 11, 2009* +
_Topical Agendas for Technical Committees Published_

CalConnect XV, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and a CalConnect Roundtable (Members Meeting), will be held in Redwood Shores (San Francisco Bay Area), California, on Monday-Friday, June 1-5, 2009, hosted by http://www.oracle.com[Oracle].

The IOP Testing will take place all day Monday and Tuesday June 1-2, and Wednesday morning, ending at noon on Wednesday June 3rd. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 3rd, and last through early afternoon Friday the 5th. An optional Introductory Q & A about CalConnect, intended for first-time attendees, is scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 3rd.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: The IOP Test Event event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop0906.shtml[IOP Test Event June 2009] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as we get nearer to the event.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

_*Please Note:* This is a regular IOP test event focused on calendaring servers and desktop clients. The next Mobile Calendaring IOP Test Event has not been confirmed but will probably take place in Europe in November 2009._

*Roundtable XV:* The Roundtable Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday morning will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, possibly demonstrations resulting from the IOP testing earlier in the week, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place in Room 202 of the Oracle Conference Center at 350 Oracle Parkway, Redwood Shores, California 94065. For a view of the immediate area and the location of the Oracle Conference Center, see http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=350+oracle+parkway,+redwood+shores,+CA&sll=37.531799,-122.264287&sspn=0.003233,0.006952&ie=UTF8&ll=37.532012,-122.266631&spn=0.006466,0.017982&t=h&z=17&iwloc=A[Oracle Conference Center].

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:*The San Francisco Bay Area is served by three airports:http://www.sjc.org/[San Jose Mineta Airport (SJC)],http://www.flysfo.com/default.asp[San Francisco International (SFO)], andhttp://www.flyoakland.com/[Oakland International (OAK)].

Redwood Shores is only about 10 miles south of San Francisco International Airport, and perhaps 30 miles north of San Jose International. Oakland International is on the east side of the Bay and less convenient. SFO has the most flights and airlines serving it, but you may be able to find less expensive fares via SJC or OAK.

*Ground Transportation:*Information on rental cars and shuttles are available on all three airport websites. The hotels listed below are all within walking distance of the Conference Center (the Fairfield Inn is furthest), so it is possible to avoid having a rental car if you wish to use an shuttle or public transportation to and from the airport.

[[lodging]]
