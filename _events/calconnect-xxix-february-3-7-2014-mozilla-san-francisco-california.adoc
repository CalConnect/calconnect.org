a| *CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: At this meeting, we expect both regular interoperability testing with local and remote servers and clients, and mobile device testing. A participating organization may register for either or both for a single registration fee, but should be aware that they may require additional individuals to participate in both activities.

The Interoperability Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop1402.shtml[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event February 2014] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

_Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the Interoperability testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._

*Roundtable XXIX:* The Roundtable Technical Conference/Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon's final sessions will be the Technical Committee wrap-up and the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

International Visitors

International visitors who are not U.S. Citizens or hold a valid U.S. passport should acquaint themselves with any changes in U.S. travel and visitor policy since their last visit to the U.S. at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/[]. Attendees who require a Letter of Invitation to obtain a visa should contact Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director, at mailto:dave.thewlis@calconnect.org[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org]. Please be aware that you must have registered for the event before a Letter of Invitation can be issued. San Francisco is the most practical airport for international arrivals and departures although the other two offer some international service.

[[registration]]
== Registration Information

Please see link:{{'/events/event-registration-payment' | relative_url}}[Registration and Payment Options] to choose your registration type and payment option for the Roundtable and/or the CalConnect Interoperability Test Events. Note that you must register separately for the Roundtable and for the Test Event. You may register at any time once registration has been announced and the registration pages are available.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place at Mozilla's San Francisco Facility, located at 2 Harrison Street, San Francisco, California. (For those who know San Francisco, this is the Hills Bros Coffee building), at the foot of Harrison Street at The Embarcadero http://is.gd/0rPlGH[]. It is about than a kilometer from the Embarcadero BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit, the local metro system) Station, and on the Muni "N" light rail line running from the Embarcadero Station down The Embarcadero and past Harrison Street.

_Please note: Due to high hotel prices in downtown San Francisco we are using a hotel across the San Francisco Bay in Berkeley as our conference hotel. We will commute between the hotel and San Francisco on BART. (While there are more reasonably priced hotels in San Francisco, they are inconvenient in terms of distance and transportation alternatives.)_

For a map showing the locations of Mozilla, the Conference Hotel, and BART/Metro stations, see http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&msa=0&msid=214983185398130768599.0004e91f6ef73ef7c3a15[CalConnect XXIX Locations].

*Parking at Mozilla:* There are several parking options nearby at a cost of $16-25/day if you arrive in time for the early bird rates (before 9am). There is a garage directly below 2 Harrison Street which charges about $20/day. The best nearby option is in the 400 block on Spear Street, at $16/day. It's a little awkward to find the first time -- this is the view of the driveway: http://is.gd/9SIm9w[]. It's only a 3 minute walk to Mozilla.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* The San Francisco Bay Area is served by three airports: http://www.flysfo.com/default.asp[San Francisco International (SFO)], http://www.flyoakland.com/[Oakland International (OAK)], and http://www.sjc.org/[San Jose Mineta Airport (SJC)].

The nearest airport to the conference hotel is Oakland International; however San Francisco International is likely to be more convenient as there is direct BART (rapid transit) service from the airport itself to 1/2 block from the conference hotel (from Oakland, there is a short shuttle bus ride from the airport to the nearest BART station). San Jose is substantially further away and less convenient to Berkeley.

*Ground Transportation:* We strongly recommend taking http://www.bart.gov[BART], the Bay Area Rapid Transit, from either San Francisco or Oakland airport to Berkeley. http://www.bart.gov/guide/airport/index.aspx[BART Airport Connections] provides specific information on flying into and leaving from these airports. The http://www.bart.gov/stations/index.aspx[Downtown Berkeley] BART Station is 1/2 block from the hotel.

_If you arrive at San Francisco International, take the AirTrain to the BART station at Garage G. Take the Pittsburg/Bay Point train and change at the 19th Street Oakland station to the Richmond train to Downtown Berkeley If you arrive at Oakland International, take the Air Bart shuttle to the BART station and take a Richmond train to Downtown Berkeley._

If you must drive, information on rental cars and shuttles are available on all three airport websites, and the hotel offers a parking arrangement with a nearby self-parking garage.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

The Shattuck Plaza hotel in Berkeley is the Conference Hotel for this meeting. Those who were at the CalConnect event at the University of California, Berkeley three years ago (February 2011) will remember this hotel as it was our conference hotel for that meeting. It is within 1/2 block of a BART station, and six stops from The Embarcadero Station in San Francisco, the closest station to Mozilla. The hotel is offering CalConnect a special rate of 17% below the lowest available rate at the time of booking. Our room block ends on Friday 17 January 2014; after that date the discount may or may not be available depending on hotel occupancy.

http://www.hotelshattuckplaza.com/

To book your room by phone, call direct at 510-845-7300 or toll free at 866-466-9199 and ask for the _CalConnect_ conference rate. To book online, please go to https://booking.ihotelier.com/istay/istay.jsp?hotelid=17233[]. Select "Promo/Corporate Code" at the top left and enter __CALCONNECT__as your passcode, and your date range. CalConnect discounted rates and the available room types will immediately be displayed for the selected dates of stay.

The room rate will be 17% off the Best Available Rate at the time you book which means it is very likely to be higher as we get closer to the event -- so book early and save!

*Traveling between the conference hotel and the Mozilla Facility:* The Downtown Berkeley BART Station is 1/2 block from the hotel. Take EITHER a Richmond-->Daly City/Milbrae train (which will go to San Francisco), or a Richmond-->Fremont train and change at the 12th street station to any train going to Daly City/Milbrae. Get off at the http://www.bart.gov/stations/embr/index.aspx[Embarcadero] station (first San Francisco station). From this station the Mozilla building is about a kilometer walk,or you can take the F, J, KT, or N light rail lines directly from the Embarcadero station (different level) to the Embarcadero at Harrison Street Metro stop.

[[bofs]]
==== BOFs

*Peer Review* Tue 1330-1430

This is an opportunity during the interoperability testing to discuss how your product uses the standards and discuss ways in which you could make more use of the standards or extend functionality and capabilities.

*iSchedule Domain Identifier* Wed 1030-1200

Goal: define the roadmap of deployment of the iSchedule protocol, taking into account existing service provider features and capabilities related to scheduling (in particular issues like user identifiers, iMIP gatewaying, etc).

1. Statement of overall problem +
 3:30 2. Overview of proposals to date +
 3. Decision time: what do we do?

+
 Requests for new BOF sessions can be made at the Monday opening of the Interoperability Test Event, and the Wednesday opening of the Roundtable, and BOFs will be scheduled at that time. However spontaneous BOF sessions are welcome to be requested during the Roundtable and will be scheduled if time can be found.
