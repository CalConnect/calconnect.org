CalConnect conference attendees **must register separatel**y to attend the Codefest.

*CalConnect Public Time Zone Workshop:* The Time Zone Workshop will be *Tuesday February 5th* from 13:30 to 17:30 at the Google facility. This workshop will be focussed on the potential impact of EU Summer Time changes and how the changes might be mitigated; please see our link:{{'/news/2018/10/30/calconnect-calls-eu-reconsider-timeline-proposed-seasonal-time-changes' | relative_url}}[news release].
