CalConnect XLIII will be held in Karlsruhe, Germany, on September 24-27, 2018, hosted by 1&1.

This event is the first preview of our new conference format. CalConnect XLIII will be four days (Monday through Thursday), and brings together, as a single event and with a single fee, our traditional conference (Conference Track), with elements of the former developers' forum (Technical Track). The two tracks are simply a handy guide to the session content, and all attendees are encouraged to attend sessions in both tracks. We will use your feedback and experience at Karlsruhe to help us fine-tune our new conference for events in 2019 and beyond.

CalConnect XLIII is open to members, and to non-members as observers.

*General Format:* Monday morning will be the opening of the technical track and an introduction for first-time attendees and observers. Monday afternoon will be the opening of the conference track, including status of CalConnect activities, and other CalConnect business, and a Public Workshop to introduce Calendaring & Scheduling to developers, which will be advertised in the Karlsruhe IT community. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings will be conference track, afternoons will be technical track. The general content of the tracks is below; the Schedule section will include sessions for both the conference and technical tracks.

*Conference track:*

* Strategic topics and discussions.
* Decisions on CalConnect business
* Small BOF sessions to gauge interest
* Small sessions to report on progress in technical tracks

*Technical track:*

* In depth discussions - possibly smaller groups as follow up from topics started at the conference
* in depth BOF sessions
* Face-to-face versions of TC calls
* Development of data formats, protocols, standards (incl. Whiteboard work).
* Joint work on CalConnect efforts such as the CalDAV Tester, iCal4J, DEVGUIDE, perhaps a reference specification for CalDAV or JSCalendar or...
* *Test Lab*
: testing of new components, testing and resolution of bugs and issues, test requests from TCs to confirm application behavior.

*Public Workshop:* Monday 24 September, 1600-1730 - Introduction into Calendaring, Scheduling, address book and Date&Time, followed by a reception at 1800. See https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/TEC-Campus/events/252358527/ for more information.
