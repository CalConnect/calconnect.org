The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday April 18-19. Wednesday April 20 will be an https://www.itfest.hk/template?series=2&id=141&lang=en#[all-day Public Event] hosted by CalConnect at the https://www.itfest.hk/template[Hong Kong ITFest].

*Please Note:* It is our intention to make this Interoperability Test Event as useful as possible for members and non-members. To this end we welcome suggestions from interested parties on what they might want to test, and with whom.Tuesday late afternoon is the Seminar at Hong Kong University, 1700-1900; some people may need to leave early in order to participate in the Seminar.Wednesday will be our Public Day at the Convention Center in Central Hong Kong; we encourage everyone to attend the Public Day and participate or offer support. We expect to offer transportation to and from the Convention Center on Wednesday.

=== Test Event Agenda

_Updated 23 February 2016_


==== Specific Areas for testing as identified by participants

CalDAV in general

CalDAV TESTER

iMIP/iTIP

ITIP/CalDAVSharing

Managed Attachments

SHARING

Server Information document

WebDAV PUSH

Simultaneous support of Apple sharing spec and new standards-based sharing specs



==== Technical Topics for Developers' Discussions

The developer discussions provide an opportunity for those who may not have been able to get on calls to engage other developers in detailed discussions.

These discussions can cover implementation approaches, protocol issues, data models etc. and may involve the entire group or small breakout sessions.



The schedule for these discussions will be decided on during the 2 days and is very flexible. Topics so far include:



API:

* Discuss and decide further details of the data model for the protocol
* Types of multi-instance events other than recurrences and representation of such "compound events" - nested components or relationships.

PATCH/DIF/Compaction


* We can talk about the use cases for patching and more compact representations. This may be part of the API doscussions

DEVGUIDE


* working session (develop/edit pages and examples)

Sharing and scheduling

* Sharing causes some paticular problems foir scheduling. We'll talk about solutions
* Also scheduling with multiple organizers or no organizer
* New properties to define default organizer calendar user address
* Suppressing scheduling when (re)loading calendars - e.g. after restore

IMIP


* interoperability problems and possible solutions, workarounds, best practices

VJOURNAL:


* Who uses it? Why isn't it used more
* "STATUS:ARCHIVED" hide it from your list of notes, but still storing it somewhere for future retrieval

Managed attachments:


* upload attachment before a new event is uploaded. Background: a client is implemented as a sync-adapter and runs asynchronously in the background usually some time after an event/task/journal has been created by a user.

"wipe trigger":


* in a corporate environment it might be a requirement to be able to remotely remove synced data (of a specific account) from a device. At present, the only way is to return empty collections (or no collections at all), but that usually affects all clients of that user (unless they use different logins, which is probably not common). Also it doesn't work if the device can't sync for whatever reason. There is no 100% reliable solution, but the current situation can certainly be improved. In times of BYOD and it's even more important that there is a standardized solution that works with all clients.



==== Baseline Testing

Final determination of what will be tested will depend on what the participants in the test event wish to test; the current set of interests is noted above. Participants may also request to test things that are not mentioned in this list (the registration form offers a place to indicate areas you wish to test). In all cases at least two participating organizations must be interested in testing a particular area or scenario to form testing pairs._Please note that you do not need finished or polished code to participate in the testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._*Possible Testing areas*

* CalDAV testing:


** Access (basic operations of CalDAV)
** Scheduling
** Sync report (depth: 1 on home collection)
** Mobile
** Sharing
** Prefer Header
* Managed Attachments
* iSchedule:


** Server discovery
** DKIM security
* Timezones:


** Service Protocol
** Timezones by Reference
* Calendar Alarms:


** Snooze
** Default alarms
* VPOLL support in clients and servers
* VAVAILABILITY support in clients and servers
* Autodiscovery protocol
* Non-gregorian calendar recurrences via RRULE and RSCALE
* iCalendar:


** Rich text and other new properties (and hashing)
* iMIP
* iTIP
* jCal, the JSON format for iCalendar - libraries and servers
* xCal, the XML format for iCalendar
* Enhanced VTODO support
* CardDAV testing:


** Generic
** Sync report
** Mobile
** vCard 4
