Monday, May 24, 2010 to Friday, May 28, 2010

Recent Changes:

*Information is current through May 12, 2010* +
_30 Minute BOF on Interoperability added to Thursday afternoon_

CalConnect XVIII, consisting of CalConnect Interoperability Test Events, and a CalConnect Roundtable (Members Meeting), will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Monday-Friday, May 24-28 2010, hosted by http://www.cmu.edu[Carnegie Mellon University].

The Interoperability Test Events will take place all day Monday and Tuesday May 24-25, and Wednesday morning May 26, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 26th, and last through early afternoon Friday the 28th. An optional __Introductory Q & A about CalConnect__, intended for first-time attendees, will be scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 26th if we have first-time attendees.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Events*: At this meeting, we will host both a regular CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and a Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event. The IOP Test Events are open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop1005.shtml[Interoperability Test Event May 2010] and http://calconnect.org/miop1005.shtml[Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event May 2010] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Roundtable XVIII:* The Roundtable Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We will be in Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, Room 203, for the entire week. (The User Special Interest Group on Wednesday morning will be in the College of Fine Arts building nearby.) For a general map of the area showing the venue locations and conference hotels please see http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105447925503204780687.000480ec02f4abc4eded0&ll=40.443485,-79.94972&spn=0.011758,0.018604&z=16[Carnegie Mellon University Area]. For a map of the University Campus, please see http://www.cmu.edu/about/visit/campus-map.shtml[]. Note that on this map the meeting venue, Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, is Building 13, and the College of Fine Arts (USIG) is Building 5. Parking will be at the East Campus Parking Building, Building P7. +
 

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Parking:*If you are driving, Parking will be in the East Campus Garage, shown as P7 on the Campus Map. It is charged hourly but capped at $10 per day.

*Hotel Shuttles and Walking:*The Holiday Inn is approximately a 15 minutes walk; the other hotels mentioned below are somewhat further. All hotels have hotel shuttles but cannot be scheduled in advance and would not be able to accommodate a large group of people traveling at the same time.

*Airport Information:*Pittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh International Airport:http://flypittsburgh.com/[flypittsburgh.com]. The airport is approximately 20 miles from the University.

*Ground Transportation:*Information on rental cars, shuttles, and public transportation is available from the airport website; see http://flypittsburgh.com/limousines_taxis_busesandhttp://flypittsburgh.com/public_transportation[]._(Caution: the links at the bottom of the aiport website pages are not fully functional; use the ones at the top of the pages.)_Our host recommends the public transportation option for getting from and to the airport. The "28X" route is perfect, starting right on the CMU campus and also going past the Holiday Inn, and it costs less than $3 each way. The link provideed above covers the details.

*Considerations for international arrival and departure:*Pittsburgh is an International Airport and offers direct arrivals from and departures to international locations.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

Carnegie Mellon Univesity has arranged a special CalConnect rate of $129/night with the Holiday Inn University Center, which will serve as our conference hotel. It is also the nearest to the meeting venue on the CMU campus, and is about 15 minutes' walk from Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. You may book online with the hotel using the Group Code of CAC. You must book by *May 14* to receive this rate.

There are other hotels in the immediate area although not as close to the meeting venue. Shadyside Inn also offers a preferred CMU rate, however the others do not. +
