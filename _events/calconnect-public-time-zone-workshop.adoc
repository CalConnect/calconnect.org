*Purpose*:

Work towards mitigating the effect of tz (such as DST) changes in the future in an increasingly technology-dependent and interconnected world

*Goals:*

* Collect known and anticipated issues, data not anecdotes.

* Develop guidance and best practices for people, governments, organizations on
how to deal with it, what could go wrong if not done correctly

* Identify technologies and methodologies, existing or practical to develop and
implement that could ease tz change transitions, e.g. TZDIST, Apple and ?Google?
variants

*Content (proposed):*

* Presentation about the EU proposal and possible political consequences
* Presentation on TZDIST and variants and what they do (and don't do)
* Open discussion on known and anticipated issues
* Guidance and best practices (separate discussions on vendors, consumers, governments?)
