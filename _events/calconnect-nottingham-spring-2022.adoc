[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information*: The most convenient airport to Nottingham is https://www.eastmidlandsairport.com/[East Midlands Airport], which serves a number of European and U.K. destinations, and is relatively close to Nottingham with good public transportation.

For those arriving from more distant locations, you would probably fly into either London Heathrow or London Gatwick, transfer to the St. Pancreas International (STP) train station, and take the train to Nottingham (NOT). A less convenient alternative would be Birrmingham or Manchester Airports; however transfer to Nottingham might take as long as from London.

*Ground Transportation:*

Rental Cars and Taxis: All airports have rental car facilities and taxis available.

*Train*: If you are buying train tickets online (http://www.thetrainline.com/), please select Nottingham (NOT) as the destination.

*From London Gatwick:* Take the First Capitol Connect train (NOT the Gatwick Express!) to London St. Pancreas (STP) and transfer to the East Midlands Railways train to Nottingham (NOT) (on the upper concourse).

*From London Heathrow:* Take the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station, transfer to St. Pancras Station by taxi or Underground, and take the train north to Nottingham. The Heathrow Express is $35 single/$55 return; the trains run every 15 minutes and the trip takes about 15 minutes. Book tickets online https://www.heathrowexpress.com/[https://www.heathrowexpress.com]. Alternatively you can take the Underground from Heathrow to St. Pancras station; it will cost less than the Heathrow Express, but take considerably longer.

*Eurostar*: If you are coming into London via Eurostar, you will arrive at London St Pancras International. Please see details above.

*From London St. Pancras Station (STP) to Nottingham (NOT):* Trains from St. Pancras run very regularly and journey times are aproximately two hours. A one way ticket is about $35. The direct service is operated by East Midlands Railways (upper concourse). First Calpitol Connect runs to Bedford but then requires a transfer to East Midlands for the remainder of the trip to Nottingham.
