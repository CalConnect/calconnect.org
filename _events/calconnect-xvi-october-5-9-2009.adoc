Recent Changes:

*Information is current through September 22, 2009* +
_Meeting venue changed, Wednesday reception location changed_

CalConnect XVI, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and a CalConnect Roundtable (Members Meeting), will be held in Cupertino, California, on Monday-Friday, October 5-9, 2009, hosted by http://www.apple.com[Apple, Inc.].

The IOP Testing will take place all day Monday and Tuesday October 5-6, and Wednesday morning, ending at noon on Wednesday October 7. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 7th, and last through early afternoon Friday the 9th. An optional Introductory Q & A about CalConnect, intended for first-time attendees, is scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 7th.

More information will be posted as it becomes available, in particular a confirmed schedule of Roundtable sessions and topical agendas should be available by mid-September.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: The IOP Test Event event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop0910.shtml[IOP Test Event September 2009] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as we get nearer to the event.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

_*Please Note:* This is a regular IOP test event focused on calendaring servers and desktop clients. The next Mobile Calendaring IOP Test Event has not been confirmed. Some possibility exists for a Mobile Calendaring IOP Test Event at CalConnect XVI in parallel with the regular test event._

*Roundtable XVI:* The Roundtable Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday morning will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, possibly demonstrations resulting from the IOP testing earlier in the week, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place in the Beatles meeting room on the first floor of Building De Anza 3, 10500 N. De Anza Blvd, Cupertino, California. This building is immediately south of the Infinite Loop campus. For a view of the Cupertino campus showing the location of building De Anza 3 see http://calconnect.org/cc16-cupertino_campus.pdf[Cupertino Campus Map]. For a map of the general area showing the location of the conference hotel, see http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105447925503204780687.00046f4f71cfaca40aa04&ll=37.327922,-122.031155&spn=0.02457,0.037122&z=15[Apple Cupertino Campus vicinity].

Please note that you can park in the De Anza 3 parking lot, or anywhere in any of the parking areas within Infinite Loop itself.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:*The San Francisco Bay Area is served by three airports:http://www.sjc.org/[San Jose Mineta Airport (SJC)],http://www.flysfo.com/default.asp[San Francisco International (SFO)], andhttp://www.flyoakland.com/[Oakland International (OAK)].

Cupertino is about 30 miles south of San Francisco International Airport, and quite close to San Jose International. Oakland International is on the east side of the Bay and less convenient. SFO has the most flights and airlines serving it, but you may be able to find less expensive fares via SJC or OAK.

*Ground Transportation:*Information on rental cars and shuttles are available on all three airport websites. The conference hotel listed below is within easy walking distance of the Apple campus are are several other hotels, so it is possible to avoid having a rental car if you wish to use a shuttle or public transportation to and from the airport.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

The conference hotel is the Cypress Hotel; while we have not arranged a specific room block (as we cannot guarantee a given number of room nights because this is a small organization), attendees are encouraged to book at this hotel. CalConnect member participants will be able to book at this hotel at the Apple rate by going to http://calconnect.org/membersonly/cc16.shtml[Members-only Apple Rate]. If the Cypress Hotel is full they will assist you in booking another hotel in the area.

The Cupertino Inn is also close to the Apple campus and frequently used by Apple visitors and is provided as the nearest alternative. +
