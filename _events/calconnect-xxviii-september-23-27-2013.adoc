CalConnect XXVIII, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and a CalConnect Roundtable Technical Conference (Members Meeting), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic Monday-Friday, September 23-27, 2013, hosted by http://www.dhl.com[DHL].

The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday September 23-24, and Wednesday morning September 25, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:00 on Wednesday September 25, and last until 18:00 Friday September 27.

An informal __Introductory Q & A about CalConnect__, intended for first-time attendees, will be scheduled on Wednesday morning the 25th for first-time attendees.

We are planning to offer Workshops on *Calendaring and Travel Itineraries* and *Federated Shared Calendars* on Thursday and Friday mornings as part of the Roundtable. More information about the workshops will be announced as soon as possible.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: At this meeting, we expect both regular interoperability testing and mobile device testing against remote servers. A participating organization may register for either or both for a single registration fee, but should be aware that they may require additional individuals to participate in both activities.

The Interoperability Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see link:{{'/iop1309.shtml' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event September 2013] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

_Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the Interoperability testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._

*Roundtable XXVIII:* The Roundtable Technical Conference/Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. In addition, workshops and symposia will be offered Thursday and Friday mornings the 26th and 27th.

Friday afternoon's final sessions will be the Technical Committee wrap-up and the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place at DHL's Prague Facility, located at V Parku 2308/10, Prague 4, 148 00, Czech Republic. The facility is a 5 minute walk from the Chodov metro station on Line C. It is only 15 minutes by subway from any major point of the city.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* Prague is served by http://www.prg.aero/en/[Ruzyne], Prague International Airport. Direct connections are available from most European cities and some connections from North America, mostly from the East Coast. Additionally, low-cost airlines such as Easyjet and Ryanair serve Prague from smaller airports in Europe and the U.K.

*Ground Transportation:* See http://www.prg.aero/en/parking-transport/transport/public-transit/[Public Transit] for information about public transportation options. A good alternative is the Airport Express which takes you to the Museum stop on the Metro "C" line which is two Metro stops from the Vysehrad stop, next door to the conference hotel (the Corinthia, see below).

If you wish you may request a hotel transfer from the airport as part of booking your hotel room (see below). This can be for 1-4 people, and costs CKZ 750. It will be billed to your hotel room.

If you prefer to make your own arrangements, DHL recommends the Umbrella Travel limosine service, which may be booked online in advance: http://www.umtf.eu/en/objednavky/[Umbrella Travel]. The price from the airport to the Corinthia Towers hotel is CZK 700 (about $35); from the airport to the DHL office is CZK 800. You may pay the taxi with a credit card if you wish. When you order a car, you should say you are from DHL. Also the driver will hold a "DHL" sign in the arriving hall.

Taxis are also available at the airport for individuals or small groups.

*Traveling between the conference hotel and the DHL Facility:* The easiest way is to use the Metro. Both the hotel and the DHL facility are on the "C" line.

[[bofs]]
=== BOFs and Workshops

==== Scheduled

*Travel Itineraries and Calendaring (Workshop)* Fri 0830-1000 +
 Booking travel is often done online using digital tools. These tools frequently generate a schedule of "events" covering different "pieces" of the itinerary - typically including time-based components. Many websites offer to export that as calendar data, however the "quality" of the data is poor, and often disjoint and not easily integrated with other tools, such as 3rd-party travel apps on mobile devices. In some cases old versions of VCALENDAR are used, in others iCalendar is used, but is missing or has inaccurate timezone data. Plus the full potential of what iCalendar could offer is missing. This workshop aims to outline the problems associated with digitial itinerary calendar data, and show how iCalendar could be a powerful solution to help improve the overall user experience.

*Federated Shared Calendars (Workshop)* Fri 0830-1000 +
 This workshop will address issues related to how users can share calendars between different calendar systems. This includes both direct iTIP style scheduling via iSchedule, as well as subscribed calendaring sharing. The goal is to propose solutions to improve the user experience in this area.

*Native CalDAV Support for PUSH* Fri 1030-1115 +
 PUSH is a "missing feature" in CalDAV and some server vendors have come up with proprietary solutions. This BOF will discuss a proposal on how to accomplish PUSH with WebDAV technology in a standardized way.

*Expanding the CalConnect Remit* Fri 1115-1200 +
 CalConnect has made significant progress in its original goals of setting and evolving Calendaring & Scheduling standards and promoting interoperability and this work must continue. In recent years we have seen an explosion of new entrants in our field, in particular smaller vendors of calendaring and related products, and vendors targeted at specific end user groups (business, education, productivity) who are in direct contact with end users. CalConnect may need to expand what it does, how it positions itself and how it explains what it provides to better meet their needs and the needs of their users, the growing world of calendaring & scheduling consumers.



==== Unscheduled

*CalDAV Tester group test fest* - Monday during Interoperability Test Event

*Timezones by Reference and eTAG Behavior* - during Interoperability Test Event

 Requests for new BOF sessions can be made at the Monday opening of the Interoperability Test Event, and the Wednesday opening of the Roundtable, and BOFs will be scheduled at that time. However spontaneous BOF sessions are welcome to be requested during the Roundtable and will be scheduled if time can be found.
