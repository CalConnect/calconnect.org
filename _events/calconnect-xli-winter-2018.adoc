CalConnect XLI, consisting of a CalConnect Test Event and Developers Forum (Interoperability Testing and technical discussions of specifications and issues) and a CalConnect Conference (Members Meeting) will be held in Sunnyvale, California on January 29 -February 2, 2018, hosted by Oath.

The Test Event/Developers Forum will take place all day Monday and Tuesday January 29-30, and Wednesday morning the 31st, ending before lunch. The Conference will open following lunch on Wednesday the 31st, and will run through Thursday and Friday, ending mid-afternoon on February 2.

*Test Event and Developers Forum*: Open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url }}[observers]; please see https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-xil-january-29-february-2-2018#test-schedule[Test Event] for both basic information about the event and for the schedule and agenda (this will be developed gradually over the summer, so check back periodically).

Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Conference:* The Conference will offer a variety of sessions on technical and higher-level topics, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. All attending member representatives and observers are welcome.

The last session on Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include future directions for Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

International visitors who are not U.S. Citizens or hold a valid U.S. passport should acquaint themselves with any changes in U.S. travel and visitor policy since their last visit to the U.S. at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/[]. Attendees who require a Letter of Invitation to obtain a visa should contact Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director, at mailto:Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org?subject=Request%20for%20Letter%20of%20Invitation[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org]. Please be aware that you must have registered for the event before a Letter of Invitation can be issued.

[[registration]]
== Registration Information

Registration is now open for CalConnect XLI; please see link:{{'/events/event-registration-payment' | relative_url }}[Event Registration] to register for the developers forum/test event and/or the conference. Note that you must register separately for the forum/test event and for the conference, however you may request a single invoice and payment.

[[location]]
== Location

The Developers Forum/Test Event (January 29-31) and the Conference (January 31-February 2) will be held at 700 First Avenue Building E, Sunnyvale, California, (This is a correction.) We will be in CL (Classrooms) 9/10 on the first floor, nearest to First Avenue.

Driving: turn onto First Avenue and then turn LEFT into Building E Parking Lot. Main interence to building is across parking lot. Check in with the Welcome Desk at this entrance.

The Wednesday Evening reception will probably be at the same location but details remain to be decided.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information*: The San Francisco Bay Area is served by three airports: http://www.flysfo.com/default.asp[San Francisco International (SFO)], http://www.flyoakland.com/[Oakland International (OAK)], and http://www.sjc.org/[San Jose Mineta Airport (SJC)].

Sunnyvale is close to San Jose International Airport and your hotel may offer a shuttle service. Oakland International is on the east side of San Francisco Bay and much less convenient to the South Bay area.

SFO has the most flights and airlines serving it and is probably the only realistic option for international travelers, but you might be able to find less expensive fares via SJC or OAK.

*Ground Transportation*: Information on rental cars and shuttles is available on all three airport web====, as is taxi service.

Please note that the meeting venue is not walkable from the conference hotel or indeed any hotels; you will need a rental car, commercial transportation, or to make ride sharing arrangements with other attendees.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

Please be aware that there are no hotels within walking distance of the venue ((700 First Avenue, Sunnyvale), so you will need a rental car, use commercial transportation, or make arrangements to ride share with other attendees regardless of where you stay. Hotels are also very expensive in this area, however we have managed to identify a conference hotel available at a reasonable rate (for this area and time). Oath does not have a special rate available to non-employees, so you will need to make an open reservation, but you can use the senior discount, auto club discount, etc. As of mid-November it was possible to book at $239 per night (plus tax) or about $267 inclusive.

There are also some economy motel chains in the area, such as Comfort Inn which may offer more attractive rates. The Comfort Inn Sunnyvale is at 900 W Weddell Drive, Sunnyvale CA 94089, 408-734-3742.
