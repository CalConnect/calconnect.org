CalConnect XXXVII, consisting of a CalConnect Developers' Forum (Interoperability Testing and technical discussions of specifications and issues) and a CalConnect Conference (Members Meeting) will be held in Dresden on September 12-16, 2016, hosted by dmfs, makers of http://smoothsync.org[SmoothSync].

The Developers' Forum will take place all day Monday and Tuesday September 12-13, and Wednesday morning, ending before lunch. The Conference will open following lunch on Wednesday, and will run through Thursday and Friday.

*Developers' Forum and Interoperability Test Event*: The Developers' Forums are open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url }}[observers]; please see https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-xxxvii-september-12-16-2016#test-schedule[Test Event] for both basic information about the event and for the schedule and agenda (this will be developed gradually over the summer, so check back periodically).

_Please Note: You donotneed finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._

*Conference:*The Conference will offer a variety of sessions on technical and higher-level topics, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. All attending member representatives and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url }}[observers]are welcome.

The last session on Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include future directions for Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

[[location]]
== Location

The Developers' Forum/Test Event (September 12-14) and the Conference (September 14-16) will be held at http://www.schloss-eckberg.de/en/[Schloss Eckberg], Bautzner Strasse 134, 01099 Dresden, Germany. Schloss Eckberg is also the conference hotel for CalConnect XXXVII. The Schloss is on a hill next to the river Elbe, and is a short tram ride from the center of Dresden.This map shows the location of the Schloss: https://www.google.de/maps/place/Schloss+Eckberg/@51.0635488,13.7972523,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4709c8c376138fad:0x7d37734c04fb0fc8?hl=en

The meeting room will be in the conference facility of the Schloss and will be announced closer to the event.


[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* Dresden is served by http://www.dresden-airport.de/homepage.html[Dresden International Airport]. Service is offered between Dresden and several European destinations, largely German (however Zurich is also served). Dresden does not offer any intercontinental flights at this time, so if you are coming from another continent you will have to transfer or shift transortation modes.

Unfortunately, Schloss Eckberg does not at this time offer a shuttle service, but are contemplating one (we have been advised to check with them later this summer). If they do institute a shuttle service we will update this page with more information.

*Taxi service*: a taxi to or from the airport costs about ¬25. Please be aware that taxi drivers usually only accept cash, and there is no Uber service in Dresden.

*Public Transportation:* Travel between the airport and the hotel may easily be done by a combination of train and tram. Please see https://www.vvo-online.de/en/timetable/timetable-information/journeys?originid=33000617&destinationid=33000296[]. The trams cost ¬2.30; there are ticket machines in the tram, but you need coins to get a ticket. There is no ticket machine on the train from the airport, but there is one in the station. Optionally you may purchase a week ticket for ¬21, which is also valid for the train to and from the airport; you may purchase this ticket at the airport station when you arrive.

The trams also offer a convenient way to get getween the Schloss and the city; please see https://www.vvo-online.de/en/timetable/timetable-information/journeys?originid=33000296&destinationid=33000003[].

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

Our conference hotel and meeting venue is http://www.schloss-eckberg.de/en/[Schloss Eckberg], Bautzner Strae 134, 01099 Dresden, Germany.

The Schloss is on a hill next to the river Elbe, and is a short tram ride from the center of Dresden.This map shows the location of the Schloss:

https://www.google.de/maps/place/Schloss+Eckberg/@51.0635488,13.7972523,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4709c8c376138fad:0x7d37734c04fb0fc8?hl=en[https://www.google.de/maps/place/Schloss+Eckberg/@51.0635488,13.7972523,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4709c8c376138fad:0x7d37734c04fb0fc8?hl=en.]

The venue is surrounded by a park and across the street is a forest, which is nice for the runners amongst us. As noted the venue is not located in the center of the city, but there is a tram to the center every 10 minutes; it takes about 20 minutes between the venue and the center.

We are offered a conference room rate, inclusive of breakfast each morning, either in the Kavaliershaus (a separate hotel building) at ¬93 per night, or in the Castle itself at a rate of ¬143 per night.

In order to obtain our conference rate, you *must book either by telephone at +49 351 8099-0 or by e-mail to i mailto:info@schloss-eckberg.de[nfo@schloss-eckberg.de]*. When booking you will need to provide the following information:

* E-mail address
* Conference Code: CalConnect
* Arrival and departure dates
* Arrival time if after 6:00 p.m.
* Room preference (in Castle or Kavaliershaus; single or double) (there is no extra charge for a double room)
* Credit Card information (if you are not comfortable sending this via e-mail you can call them instead, or after doing e-mail for the rest of the booking)

Check-in is after 3:00 p.m.; Departure is by 11:00 a.m.

*Lodging Tax:* The City of Dresden charges a lodging tax; see http://www.dresden.de/media/pdf/infoblaetter/07_Infoblatt_Gaeste_EN.pdf[]. However business travelers may apply for a refund or, if the professional nature of the trip can be declared beforehand, the lodging facility will not charge the tax.

Participants may also request to test things that are not mentioned in this list (the registration form offers a place to indicate areas you wish to test). In all cases at least two participating organizations must be interested in testing a particular area or scenario to form testing pairs._Please note that you do not need finished or polished code to participate in the testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._*Possible Testing areas*
