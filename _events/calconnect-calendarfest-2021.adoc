== Accepted talks

CalConnect launched a
link:{{'/news/2021-10-14-calendar-fest-2021-call-for-contributions' | relative_url}}[call for contributions] for CalendarFest 2021. The following talks have been accepted.

=== Ben Fortuna: Novel applications of iCalendar (how two additional properties open up the possibilities)

Abstract: iCalendar has long been associated with the interoperability of calendar and groupware applications. The introduction of new iCalendar specifications (including RFC9073) could be instrumental in the adoption of interoperability standards in a broader range of applications

_Ben Fortuna joined the Calendaring conversation in 2004 when he released https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j[iCal4], a Java implementation of iCalendar. Ben is motivated by a desire for greater interoperability with communications technologies, as he believes this is essential for the protection of fundamental human rights. Ben holds a Master of Information Systems and is currently working as a Cloud Solutions Architect for a large Australian telco._

=== Carlota Ant√≥n: Rethinking a calendar

Design thinking applied to improving the user experience of calendar apps. Connecting with the user and making digital calendars more tangible.

_Carlota Ant√≥n is a Product Designer based in Madrid. She has 7 years of experience in the design field and is currently focused on visual and interaction design as well as accessibility._

=== Johannes Raggam: The calendaring infrastructure in Plone

Abstract: The calendaring infrastructure of the Open Source CMS Plone is built around the iCalendar RFC5545 standard including recurring events and has full timezone support using the Olson database. This lightning talk gives an technical overview of our implementation, the challenges we were facing and an outlook about our future plans.

_Johannes Raggam is a long time https://plone.org/[Plone] core contributor, former Plone framework team member and the main author behind plone.app.event, the calendaring package for Plone. He works at Syslab.com and helps building the intranet software Quaive, which is built upon the CMS framework Plone._

=== Tobias Brox: On calendar servers and caldav compatibility

Abstract: As the maintainer of the https://github.com/python-caldav/caldav[python caldav (client) library] I've been writing lots of functional test code - while it has helped me finding standard compliance bugs in the library, more often than not the problem is at the server side. Actually, I haven't found a single calendar server out there that passes the full test suite. In this talk I'm going to highlight some of the most common compatibility problems, some of the more exotic ones, some servers that seems to be devolving their standard support, and talk a bit about some of the workarounds done in the library. In the end I hope there will be time for someone in the audience to explain to me that I'm all wrong, and that all the problems are on the library side. After all, I can easily fix library side problems.

_About Tobias:
I learned programming from my granddad in the 80s.
I didn't want to work with IT since that was anyway my hobby, so I was studying physics in the arctic Norway in the 90s.
I realized that IT is the only thing I'm good at, so I've been working with development, system administration (DevOps) and Open Source software since 1998.
I've been working in the computer gaming industry (FunCom), online gambling industry (NordicBet/TrioBet), and now I'm working for an IT consulting company (Redpill Linpro).
I've never been working professionally with calendaring systems, it's just a side project._
