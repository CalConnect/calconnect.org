CalConnect, the Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium, is coming to Hong Kong for our first members conference to be held in the Asia/Pacific Region.

To celebrate this special event, with our Hong Kong host organizations, OGCIO and Ribose (http://ribose.com/[ribose.com]), we are holding two additional events, https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-public-day-hong-kong-it-fest[a public day (Wednesday, April 20, 2016)] at the https://www.itfest.hk/template?series=2&id=141&lang=en[Hong Kong International ITFest], and a seminar at https://www.hku.hk[The University of Hong Kong]on Tuesday evening April 19th.

CalConnect members, calendaring & scheduling entrepreneurs and software developers, will present a program suitable for both technical (computer science students and faculty, software developers) as well as less technical audiences:

1700 - 1715  Intro to CalConnect and Interoperable Calendaring & Scheduling +
1715 - 1745 C&S Grand Challenges - where weve been, where were going (panel) +
1745 - 1830  C&S for the Developer -- a look at CalDAV, web services, TZ server, open source, standards (Panel) +
1830 - 1900 Question & Answer session

Following the formal program, there will be an opportunity to speak with the CalConnect presenters.

Although CalConnect is not a formal standards body, over the last five years, most of the Calendaring standards development and discussion have taken place in CalConnect. Our link:{{'/membership' | relative_url}}[membership] includes some of the world's largest software development organizations, as well as emergent vendors and startups, end user organizations, interested individuals, and research universities.

CalConnect is very excited to be coming to Hong Kong for our link:{{'/events/calconnect-public-day-hong-kong-it-fest' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Public Day at the Hong Kong IT Fest] and the link:{{'/events/calconnect-xxxvi-april-18-22-2016' | relative_url}}[36th Conference], and we are equally excited to be able to share and discuss our work with the students and faculty at Hong Kong University.

=== Conference Details

CalConnect conference planners share a "reading list" for conference attendees to help them prepare for, and participate in conference discussions. It is not a requirement that attendees familiarize themselves with all these material,s, but we believe it will make the experience more enjoyable and valuable, especially for first time attendees.

Although the Seminar is intended to be accessible to technical and non-technical audiences, Seminar attendees might find it interesting to see some of these technical references.



*Reading list for CalConnect XXXVI conference attendees*
