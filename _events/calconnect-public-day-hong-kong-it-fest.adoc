==== Background

CalConnect, the Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium, is a partnership between vendors of calendaring & scheduling systems and tools, and users of those tools. Our focus is interoperable calendaring and scheduling. Through promoting, advising, educating, and the work of our link:{{'/about/technical-committees' | relative_url}}[Technical Committees,] we advance the state of interoperable calendaring and of interoperable scheduling. Although CalConnect is not a formal standards body, over the last five years, most of the Calendaring standards development and discussion have taken place in CalConnect. link:{{'/membership' | relative_url}}[Our membership] includes some of the world's largest software development organizations, as well as emergent vendors and startups, end user organizations, interested individuals, and research universities.

CalConnect held its first conference and interoperability event in 2005, our first European conference 2011 in the Czech Republic, and now we are holding our link:{{'/events/calconnect-xxxvi-april-18-22-2016' | relative_url}}[36th conference April 18-22 2016], in the Asia/Pacific region, in Hong Kong.

CalConnect is not only coming to Hong Kong to talk to you, but also to listen to you, to better understand Asia/Pacific IT, Asia Pacific culture, Asia Pacific standards, and to better understand how to serve Asia/Pacific IT, government, and businesses. We cannot achieve our goals of truly interoperable calendaring and scheduling without the participation of the Asia/Pacific region, home to more than half the worlds people. Please join us in Hong Kong as the next step toward making that goal a reality.
