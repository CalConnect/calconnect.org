[[transportation]]
== Transportation

The nearest airport to UC Irvine is http://www.ocair.com/[John Wayne Airport] (SNA), less than five miles from UC Irvine and close to the conference hotel. Although the airport is called international, travelers from Europe or Asia will almost certainly have to arrive at http://www.lawa.org/welcomeLAX.aspx[Los Angeles Interanational Airport] (LAX) in order to pass customs. Los Angeles International is about a 45 minute drive from UC Irvine (be warned that in heavy traffic it can take quite a bit longer). Alternatively foreign travelers can arrive at a more distant airport, such as San Francisco, and transfer to a short flight to John Wayne Airport.

Public transportation and rental cars are available at both airports. Additionally, our conference hotel offers a shuttle service between John Wayne Airport and the hotel (see hotel information below).

If you have a rental car you will be able to drive to and from the meeting venue, parking in the Student Center Parking Structure for a fee (see Location above).

The conference hotel offers a shuttle service between the hotel and UC Irvine, which must be booked in advance. Nearer to the event we will see if it is practical to arrange for a group shuttle in the morning and evening.

_We plan to survey registered participants a week or so before the event and find out how many people would be interested in using this shuttle service to go to and from UCI, and then do a mass booking. Note that this will NOT work for Monday or Wednesday evenings, so different arrangements will need to be made for the Test Event Dinner on Monday, and the Reception on Wednesday._
