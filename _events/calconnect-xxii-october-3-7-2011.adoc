Monday, October 03, 2011 to Friday, October 07, 2011

Recent Changes:

*Current to 26 September 2011* +
_Hotel Meeting Room specified_

CalConnect XXII, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event, and a CalConnect Roundtable Technical Conference, will be held in Prague, Czech Republic, hosted by http://www.kerio.com[Kerio Technologies].

The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday October 3-4, and Wednesday morning October 5, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:00 on Wednesday the 5th, and last through Friday afternoon the 7th.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: At this meeting, we hope to offer both a regular CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and a Mobile Calendaring Interoperability Test Event, which will be combined into a single physical event. A participating organization may register for either or both events for a single registration fee, but should be aware that they may require additional individuals to participate in both events (they will take place in parallel).

The Interoperability Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop1110.shtml[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event October 2011] for current information. Check back periodically as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Roundtable Technical Conference:*

The Roundtable Technical Conference will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. In addition, workshops/symposia will be offered on Thursday and Friday mornings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

International Visitors

Please see http://www.learn4good.com/travel/czech_republic_visa.htm#req for information about visas required, etc.

The March 2011 IETF meeting was in Prague and the host provided some useful information about Prague and Czech for travelers: see http://www.ietf80.cz[].

[[registration]]
== Registration Information

Please see link:{{'/events/event-registration-payment' | relative_url}}[Registration and Payment Options] to choose your registration type and payment option for the Roundtable and/or the CalConnect Interoperability Test Events. Note that you must register separately for the Roundtable and for the Test Events.

*Special Registration Fees*: For CalConnect XXII, the registration fee for non-members is a single fee of $350 which covers one participant in either the Interoperability Test Event, the Roundtable Technical Conference, or both. You must still execute separate registration forms. For members who are not calendaring vendors, the registration for the Interoperability Test Event is $350 which covers one participant but does not include the Roundtable. In all cases additional participants will be charged the regular fee for additional Test Event participants ($150 each) or Roundtable participants ($350 before 17 Setember, $395 thereafter).
