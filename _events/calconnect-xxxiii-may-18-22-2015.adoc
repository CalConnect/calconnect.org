a| *CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*:

The Interoperabilty Test Events are open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see link:{{'/iopnextalias.html' | relative_url}}[Next CalConnect Interoperability Test Event] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

_Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the interoperability testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._

*CalConnect Conference XXXIII:* The CalConnect Conference will offer a variety of sessions on technical and higher-level topics, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. All attending member representatives and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.
