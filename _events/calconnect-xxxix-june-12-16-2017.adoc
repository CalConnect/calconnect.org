CalConnect XXXIX, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and Developers Forum, and a CalConnect Conference, will be held in Seattle, Washington, California, on June 12-16 13-17, 2017, hosted by https://www.tandemcal.com/[Tandem].

*Developers' Forum and Interoperability Test Event*: The Developers' Forums and Test Events are open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url }}[observers]; please see https://www.calconnect.org/events/clone-calconnect-xxxix-june-12-16-2017#test-schedule[Test Event] for basic information about the event and for the schedule and agenda (this will be developed gradually, so check back periodically).

_Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._

*Public Workshop:* A https://www.calconnect.org/misc/calconnect-public-workshop-june-14-2017-calconnect-xxxix-seattle[public workshop, Introduction to Calendaring and to Scheduling], Wednesday afternoon 14 June from 14:00 to 18:00.

*Conference:* The Conference will offer a variety of sessions on technical and higher-level topics, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. All attending member representatives and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url }}[observers] are welcome.

The last session on Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include future directions for Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

[[registration]]
== Registration Information

Please see link:{{'/events/event-registration-payment' | relative_url}}[Registration and Payment Options] to choose your registration type and payment option for the CalConnect Conference and/or the CalConnect Interoperability Test Event and Developers Forum. Note that you must register separately for the Conference and for the Test Event, but you may request a combined invoice. You may register at any time for the next event.

[[location]]
== Location

CalConnect XXXIX will be held at http://www.galvanize.com/campuses/seattle-pioneer-square/[Galvanize Pioneer Square], 111 S. Jackson Street at First Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98104, in the Pioneer Square district of Seattle. We will be in the **main conference room on the fiifth floor**, next to the elevator.

The closest Light Rail Station is International/Chinatown Bay C, a short walk down S. Jackson Street to the venue. Here is a https://www.google.com/maps/place/International+District/Chinatown+Station+-+Bay+C/@47.5980932,-122.3303273,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x54906abcb9710af5:0xeec22da20dd8928f!8m2!3d47.5980932!4d-122.3281333[map of the immediate area of the venue] showing the light rail station. The venue is about 8 blocks from the Conference Hotel, the http://www.alexishotel.com/[Kimpton Alexis Seattle], at 1007 First Avenue at Madison.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

Seattle is served by the http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Pages/default.aspx[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport], generally called SeaTac. SeaTac is about 20 miles south of Seattle, and offers both public transportation and rental cars. (We do not recommend a rental car unless you must, due to the high cost of parking in downtown Seattle.)

The easiest way to get from SeaTac to downtown Seattle is the http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Parking-and-Transportation/Ground-Transportation/Pages/Public-Transit.aspx[Seattle Light Rail] system. As noted under Location, the nearest Light Rail station to the venue is International District/Chinatown Bay C. The nearest Light Rail station to the conference hotel is the Pioneer Square Station or University Street Station, the next two stations north. The journey takes about 40 minutes and the cost is less than $4 U.S. Trains run every 6-15 minutes depending on time of day, and are available from 5 a.m. until midnight or later.

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

Lodging costs in Seattle for the period of the event, June 12-16, are quite high, probably because of the tourist season. We have managed to identify a conference hotel; however the CalConnect rate will depend on availability. We encourage you to book your room as soon as possible.

The conference hotel is the http://www.alexishotel.com/[Kimpton Alexis Seattle], at 1007 First Avenue at Madison, about half a mile from the venue. The nearest http://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/light-rail/link-light-rail/map[Light Rail] stations to the hotel are the Pioneer Square station and the University Street station, one and two stops north of the https://www.google.com/maps/place/International+District%2FChinatown+Station+-+Bay+C/@47.6038734,-122.3341736,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x54906abcb9710af5:0xeec22da20dd8928f!4b1!8m2!3d47.5980932!4d-122.3281333[International District/Chinatown Bay C station].

The Kimpton has offered us a group rate of $275 per night for those willing to commit to their stay to us, such that CalConnect will guarantee the room costs. In order to secure this offer we had to commit at the beginning of April following a quick notification to possible attendees. The Kimpton has offered to make this rate available to other CalConnect attendees as long as availability permits.

The least expensive hotel in the area of the venue appears to be the https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotel-details.48128.html?iata=00170260&ssob=PSPBM0304G&cid=PSPBM0304G:google:PBMS3%20|%20Best%20Western%20|%20Exact:best%20western%20plus%20pioneer%20square%20hotel[Best Western Plus Pioneer Square], which is quoting a best rate of $289 per night for the days of our event (slightly less for AAA/CAA or Senior).

AirBnB is certainly an alternative especially in the Capitol Hill Light Rail station area, a few stops north of Pioneer Square. Additionally, lower rates may be available very close to CalConnect week if hotels still have vacancies, but have backup plans.
