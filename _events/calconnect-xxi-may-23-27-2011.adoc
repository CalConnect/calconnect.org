Monday, May 23, 2011 to Friday, May 27, 2011

Recent Changes:

*Information is current to May 16, 2011* +
_Thursday schedule adjusted to put CalDAV and iSchedule in the morning_

CalConnect XXI, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event, and a CalConnect Roundtable (Members Meeting), will be held at NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California, **Monday-Friday, May 23-27, 2011**, hosted by http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html[NASA Ames].

The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday May 23-24, and Wednesday morning May 25, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:30 on Wednesday the 25thh, and last through early afternoon Friday the 27th. An optional __Introductory Q & A about CalConnect__, intended for first-time attendees, will be scheduled at 11:00 on Wednesday the 25th if we have first-time attendees.

A special *Workshop on Tasks* will be held Wednesday afternoon during the Roundtable, and an optional tour of two major simulation facilities at the NASA Ames Research Center will be offered by NASA Friday afternoon the 27th after the close of the Roundtable.

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*:

The Interoperability Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see link:{{'/iop1105' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event May 2011] for current information. Check back often as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Roundtable XXI:*

The Roundtable Members Meeting will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings.

Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

*Special Events:*

*Workshop on Tasks*: The workshop will be held Wednesday afternoon from 1330-1530 as part of the Roundtable; however it is open to non-Roundtable attendees by invitation and registration. The goal of the CalConnect workshop is to examine the key use cases for tasks with the goal of promoting use of iCalendar and CalDAV as a standards-based solution to task management and synchronization. We expect that extensions to both iCalendar and possibly CalDAV may be needed to support the key features that application developers require. For more information about the Workshop please see http://calconnect.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/calconnect-workshop-on-tasks-may-25-2011/[].

*NASA Ames Research Center Tour*: NASA is offering us a tour of the FutureFlight Centra and Crew-Vehicle Systems Research Facility after the close of the Roundtabler on Friday afternoon. The tour will take about an hour; we will leave from the Conference Center at 1330 and we should be back before 1500. For more information about these simulation simulation labs in the Aviation Systems Division at NASA Ames see: http://www.aviationsystemsdivision.arc.nasa.gov/facilities/index[].  

International Visitors

International visitors who are not U.S. Citizens or hold a valid U.S. passport should acquaint themselves with any changes in U.S. travel and visitor policy since their last visit to the U.S. at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/[]. Attendees who require a Letter of Invitation to obtain a visa should contact Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director, at mailto:dave.thewlis@calconnect.org[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org]. Please be aware that you must have registered for the event before a Letter of Invitation can be issued. San Francisco is the most practical airport for international arrivals and departures although the other two offer some international service.

*Special Considerations for non-U.S. Citizens at NASA Ames*: NASA Ames is a government facility and has security restrictions to enter the Ames area, which includes the Conference Center. U.S. citizens and non-citizen permanent residents ("Green Card" holders) must show a Driver's License or proof of citienship and, if a non-citizen, your green card to enter. If you are not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as defined above, you must have applied for an official visitor invitiation and visitor pass. CalConnect has initiated this process for all member representatives who may attend and who would fall into this category. *If you are considering attending CalConnect XXI, are not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, and have not heard from us already, you must contact us immediately to apply for a visitor pass. You will not be able to enter the NASA Ames area without a visitor pass.* If you have any questions please contact Dave Thewlis at mailto:dave.thewlis@calconnect.org[Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org] as soon as possible; it can take up to 8 weeks to receive a visitor pass and we have to arrange this through NASA's international visitors department.

[[location]]
== Location

The Interoperability Test Event and the Roundtable will take place at the http://naccenter.arc.nasa.gov/index.php[NASA Ames Conference Center], 500 Severyns Road, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Mountain View, California. Please see http://naccenter.arc.nasa.gov/index.php for information about the Conference Center. Please see http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=214983185398130768599.0004a01af2a11e4c9c429&z=15[NASA Ames and surrounding area] for the NASA Ames area, including the location of the meeting venue and our conference hotel.

*Parking:* Parking is available near the Conference Center. See http://naccenter.arc.nasa.gov/maps/img/NACC_Parking.pdf[Parking at the NASA Ames Conference Center] for a map showing the conference center and parking areas.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* The San Francisco Bay Area is served by three airports: http://www.flysfo.com/default.asp[San Francisco International (SFO)], http://www.flyoakland.com/[Oakland International (OAK)], and http://www.sjc.org/[San Jose Mineta Airport (SJC)].

The nearest airport is San Jose Mineta International Airport, which is about 8 miles from NASA and the conference hotel. However, San Francisco International (about 30 miles) is likely to have more flights (especially more international flights) and possibly less expensive flights.

*Ground Transportation:* Information on rental cars and shuttles are available on all three airport websites. It is also possible to get to the conference hotel via public transportation. It is not feasible to walk to the venue from any hotel but the NASA Lodge, but we will be trying to arrange car pooling between the conference hotel and the venue. 

[[lodging]]
== Lodging

Our conference hotel will be the Sunnyvale Sheraton. The Sheraton is very close to NASA Ames (just south) and offers attractive facilities and a convenient location. The Sheraton will also host our Thursday evening dinner. We plan to arrange car pools between the Sheraton and the NASA Ames Conference Center each morning and evening. In addition, the Sheraton offers a by-request complimentary shuttle within a 5 mile radius which you may also use; however it is first-come first-served and by request. The shuttle operations between 0700 and 1900.

The Sheraton is offering us a special discounted rate for our conference of $189 per night, which also includes internet access. To book your room at this rate, please use the following link: http://www.starwoodmeeting.com/Book/CalConnect2011[]. Note that this rate is only available until the end of April, and is subject to room availability. Alternatively, or if you have any questions, please contact Michelle Rodrigues, Sales Coordinator, at mailto:michelle.rodrigues@sunnyvalesheraton.com[michelle.rodrigues@sunnyvalesheraton.com], or call her at +1 408-542-8261. If you are contacting her to book instead of using the web link above, be sure to tell her you are attending the CalConnect Conference at NASA, and give her your name and the dates you wish the room.

_Please be aware that this is a courtesy rate based on availability. It is only available through the end of April, and no room block has been established. Be sure to book early to take advantage of this rate._ +
