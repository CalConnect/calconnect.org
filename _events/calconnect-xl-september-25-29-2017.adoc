CalConnect XL, consisting of a CalConnect Test Event and Developers Forum (Interoperability Testing and technical discussions of specifications and issues) and a CalConnect Conference (Members Meeting) will be held in Cologne on September 25-29, 2017, hosted by Open-Xchange.

The Test Event/Developers Forum will take place all day Monday and Tuesday September 25-26, and Wednesday morning the 27th, ending before lunch. The Conference will open following lunch on Wednesday, the 27th, and will run through Thursday and Friday.

*Test Event and Developers Forum:* Open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url }}[observers]; please see https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-xl-september-25-29-2017#test-schedule[Test Event] for both basic information about the event and for the schedule and agenda (this will be developed gradually over the summer, so check back periodically).

_Please Note: You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions_.

*Conference*: The Conference will offer a variety of sessions on technical and higher-level topics, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. All attending member representatives and observers are welcome.

The last session on Friday afternoon will be the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include future directions for Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

The meeting facility is only about 100 meters from the conference hotel, the https://www.motel-one.com/en/hotels/cologne/koeln-mediapark/[Motel One Media Park], Am K¼mpchenshof 2, 50670 K¶ln.

There will be signage at Komed House to direct you to the CalConnect meeting room.

The Wednesday Evening reception will be at Open-Xchange, Hohenzollernring 72, 50672 K¶ln, 16th Floor. You will have to check in with the receptionist on the ground floor; tell them you are with CalConnect and visiting Open-Xchange to be allowed access to the elevators.

[[transportation]]
== Transportation

*Airport Information:* Cologne is served by the http://www.cologne-airport.com/[Cologne-Bonn International Airport (CGN)]. The airport is relatively small but offers connections through several other airports. Distance to the venue and conference hotel is approximately 15km, 40â¬ by taxi or 3â¬ by Train.

For transport from the Cologne-Bonn International Airport to the Media Park by train, there are two lines of the "S-Bahn" that operate frequently: S13 (towards Sindorf), and S19 (towards D»ren). For either train, exit at station "Hansaring", then head south-west on the Hansaring (about 500 meters) and turn right into AmK¼mpchenshof. Motel One and the Media Park are straight ahead.

For intercontinental travelers, Frankfurt (FRA) or D¼sseldorf (DUS) are likely to be more convenient, and both offer train service to Cologne on at least an hourly basis. Price is well under 50â¬ if booked in advance; Frankfurt-Cologne might cost 100â¬ if booked at the train station. If you have your flight scheduled you are welcome to contact our hosts to help find the best and least expensive connection.

From the Cologne Bahnhof, you can take the "S-Bahn" to "Hansaring". Several lines serve this connection (S6, S11, S12, S13, S19), just one stop. Taxi might be more convenient with luggage, should just be a couple euros.

*Train and Car*: Cologne is also served by extensive train and autobahn connections for those traveling by train or car.

*Inner City:* Cologne has extensive subway and tram networks. Additionally, it is approximately a 20 minute walk from the Media Park to the center of the city.

*Please Note:* Credit cards are not necessarily accepted universally in Germany, in particular by taxis. ATMs (cash tills) should be available at all airports, train stations, etc. and you should provide yourself with some cash if you haven't already.

=== Specific Areas for testing as identified by participants

Specific testing areas may include the following; also see Baseline Testing below.

* Sharing
* CalDAV
* CardDAV
* iMIP
* API <--> iCalendar
* Calendar publication and subscription models

=== Technical Topics for Developers Forum Discussions


The developer discussions provide an opportunity for those who may not have been able to get on calls to engage other developers in detailed discussions.

These discussions can cover implementation approaches, protocol issues, data models etc. and may involve the entire group or small breakout sessions.



The schedule for these discussions will be decided on during the 2.5days and is very flexible.



Specific discussion areas for CalConnec XL include at least:

* Wikipedia updates (hackathon)
* How to run the test suite - entry for Devguide; Mike intends to do work on basic set of tests at event
* Discuss relationships queries; if in CalDAV no effect on 5545
* CalConnect ical4j
* Subscription upgrade (obscure points e.g. head versus options)
* Calendar Series draft
* Revisit VPOLL - get demo going again?
* Security concerns with VCARDs
* Open floor


Please see the Reading List for the event at . The list contains URLs to all standards, drafts and specifications to be discussed or tested.

In all cases at least two participating organizations must be interested in testing a particular area or scenario to form testing pairs._Please note that you do not need finished or polished code to participate in the testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions._*Possible Testing areas*
