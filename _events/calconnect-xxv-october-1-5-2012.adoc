Recent Changes:

*Current to 25 September 2012* +
_Minor schedule rearrangement for EVENTPUB, FREEBUSY, and XML TCs_

CalConnect XXV, consisting of a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event, and a CalConnect Roundtable Technical Conference, will be held in Zurich, Switzerland, hosted by http://www.google.com[Google].

The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday October 1-2, and Wednesday morning October 3, ending at noon. The Roundtable will begin with lunch at 12:00 on Wednesday the 3rd, and last through Friday afternoon the 7th.  

*CalConnect Interoperability Test Event*: At this meeting, we plan to offer both regular and mobile interoperabilty testing at the CalConnect Interoperability Test Event. A participating organization may register for either or both events in a single regisstration, but should be aware that they may require additional individuals to participate in both events (they will take place in parallel).

The Interoperability Test Event is open to both members and non-members as participants or as link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers]; please see http://calconnect.org/iop1210.shtml[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event October 2012] for current information. Check back periodically as this will be updated as more information becomes available.

You do not need finished or polished code to participate in the IOP testing; in fact as soon as you have something working at all, testing against other participants can help debugging and code development, especially in identifying red herrings and wrong decisions.

*Roundtable Technical Conference:* The Roundtable Technical Conference will offer Technical Committee sessions, to which all members and link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url}}[observers] are welcome, informal BOFs (Birds of a Feather sessions), plus additional sessions and committee meetings. In addition, workshops/symposia will be offered on Thursday and Friday mornings (more detailed information as we get closer to October).

Friday afternoon's final sessions will be the Technical Committee wrap-up and the full Plenary meeting of the Consortium, open to all participants. This session will include report-outs from all Technical Committees, and establishment of future goals and directions for the Consortium.

The venue for CalConnect week will be at Google's Zurich campus, located at Brandschenkestrasse 110, 8002 Zurich.
