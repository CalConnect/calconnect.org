== PUSH for CalDAV

"Extend CalDAV and CardDAV with standardized support for PUSH notifications"

At present CalDAV and CardDAV clients have to poll the server at regular
intervals to check for changes. To provide a close to "real time" user
experience and present updates and notifications almost immediately to
the user, a client has to poll at a high frequencies, possibly at the
expense of higher consumption of resources like bandwidth and traffic,
processing time and battery power. We will define methods to
advertise/discover PUSH protocols supported by a server. In addition it
will specify a generic PUSH protocol based on existing WebDAV
technologies that can be used when no other PUSH method is available. To
help implementers we will provide guidelines to PUSH support on servers
and clients.
