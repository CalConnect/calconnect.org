== Abstract Calendaring API

We need a full "CRUD" (Create/Read/Update/Delete) Abstract Application
Programming Interface and Calendaring Architecture for Calendaring and
Scheduling.

An Abstract Calendaring API from which fully compliant interfaces can be
created will enable "Calendaring as a Platform" -- that is, any process
running on a system can use the API to perform calendar and scheduling
operations against any calendaring and scheduling implementation running
on that system.
