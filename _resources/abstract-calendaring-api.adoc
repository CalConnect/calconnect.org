= 7 Things You Should Know About the Abstract Calendaring API

== What is it?

An abstract calendaring API is a model of calendar data and the
operations upon it that is platform-independent. It specifies the rules
and constraints on the data elements and ways in which they can be
created and modified.

In contrast to common calendaring implementations such as the CalDAV
protocol, the abstract calendaring API does not address implementation
details such as authentication, networking or provisioning. Instead, an
abstract data model is defined and complemented with a description of
operations that can be performed on calendar data.


== What scenarios and/or problems does it address, or what new advantage(s) does it confer?

Calendar information appears in many different contexts such as the web,
in process control, as well as the more familiar scheduling of
meetings.

Although calendaring standards and protocols exist, no overall
calendaring architecture has been described, and it must be inferred
from the existing specifications. A need exists for such a calendaring
architecture in which new functionality can be developed to ensure
compatibility of existing work, and which relates existing work to the
architecture.

An abstract calendaring architecture needs to be defined to provide
common terminology in the form of an API to enable a high degree of
interoperability. A calendaring system is made up of various sub-systems
that handle the different aspects of data management, scheduling,
directory information, etc. (see
link:{{'/architectures/Calendaring%20Architecture.pdf' | relative_url }}[Calendaring Service Architecture]).
The components of the calendar system may be
provided by different vendors, and thus interoperability between these
components is crucial.

An abstract calendaring API defines a common vocabulary that can be used
to resolve ambiguities when attempting to integrate products with other
calendaring and scheduling systems or even when contracting development
to an external company

Implementations based on an abstract API can be more consistent in their
behaviors. Interoperability is enhanced as the different protocols and
implementations all adhere to the same model.

Some of the scenarios which the Abstract Calendaring API addresses
include:

* Calendaring applications processing device calendar data
* Scheduling across domains with different calendar services
* Embedding calendaring in devices such as thermostats
* Calendaring in web pages


== How does it work?

By providing a common understanding of how to represent and manipulate
calendar data, using the abstract calendaring API improves the
interoperability of concrete implementations. All possible operations on
the data can be defined with their expected outcomes. Implementations
can then check their actual results against that expectation.

An abstract model allows practitioners to consider calendar data and the
operations upon it without having to deal with the complexities and
requirements of any specific protocol.


== Who's doing it?

Although attempts have been made in the past, there is no accepted
standard calendaring architecture or abstract calendaring API.

The CalConnect API Technical Committee (see below) has begun work to
define an Abstract Calendaring API. We will be building on the design
and experience gained from existing calendar implementations such as
CalDAV and WS-Calendar, to create the abstract API.


== Why is it significant?

Calendaring data already exists in a wide variety of systems. An
abstract calendaring API will make it easier to incorporate calendar
data in a wider set of applications, such as energy management,
logistics, resource allocation and sharing. In the absence of having a
common architecture, individual projects will define their own models,
possibly lacking compatibility with existing protocols and data.

As the use of calendaring and scheduling protocols increases to address
requirements for scheduling independent of traditional calendaring, the
need for an architecture and abstract API becomes even more important to
ensure that implementations can take advantage of existing
implementations, libraries, and other components.


== What needs to be done, and what is CalConnect doing?

CalConnect has chartered a Technical Committee,
link:{{ '/about/technical-committees/tc-api' | relative_url }}[TC API] to
define and document a calendaring architecture encompassing the existing
calendaring and scheduling standards and protocols, and develop an
abstract calendaring API which encompasses all of the major
functionality and the object model currently available in the base
calendaring standards. In addition to the Abstract API Recommendation,
TC API will present a simple instantiation of the abstract API.


== What are the implications for calendaring and scheduling?

The abstract calendaring API opens the door to greater interoperability,
and wider usage of calendar data in a broader range of applications.

Software vendors will be able to easily incorporate calendar data within
their products, particularly those where calendar data is secondary to
their product.
