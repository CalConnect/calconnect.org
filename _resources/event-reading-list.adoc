= Event reading lists

_Last Updated September 2019_

== Introduction

The Reading Lists are primarily intended for new or first-time attendees
or for anyone who wishes to familiarize themselves more deeply with the
topics which will be under discussion both in the Developers Forum and
the Conference.

The lists are updated for each event, generally by a few weeks before
the event, although additions and changes may be made subsequently (for
example links that were not available when the list was initially
updated).

Unpublished documents, for which a link cannot be provided, will be made
available prior to the event to all registrants.
