AOL Palo Alto

Well, actually it's a few days more than three weeks. BUT the point is, if you re planning to come to AOL in Palo Alto for CalConnect XXXV, it's time to register and make your arrangements. Info about CalConnect XXXV can be found at link:{{'/calconnect35' | relative_url}}[]; registration info is at link:{{'/regtypes' | relative_url}}[/regtypes] .

Early registration will end on 27 December for the conference; as of 28 December it will go up to $395.

Remember, you can come to a CalConnect conference as an observer to decide if you want to be involved without joining first.

See you in Palo Also!
