== Interoperability Testing at CalConnect XXIV May 21-23 2012

At the upcoming link:{{'/calconnect24' | relative_url}}[CalConnect XXIV] event we will as usual be offering an Interoperability Test Event all day Monday and Tuesday May 21-22, and Wednesday morning the 23rd. At this event we *will be testing* the following:

* CalDAV Access
* CalDAV Scheduling, including Implicit Scheduling
* iMIP and iMIP Gateways
* CardDAV
* Timezone Service Protocol and Timezones by Reference

This list will be updated as additional testing areas are identified and requested by two or more testing organizations.

We *may be testing* the following if two or more testing organizations express interest:

* iSchedule
* Web Services (CalWS REST and CalWS SOAP)

In all cases at least two participating organizations must be interested in testing a particular area or scenario to form testing pairs.

Additionally, we are planning on special BOF sessions on Shared Address Books and CalDAV Test Suites during the Interoperability Test Event:

The information page for the Interoperability Test event is at link:{{'/iop1205' | relative_url}}[]. A short description of the BOFs at the test event will be added to this page in early April.

Please note that the Interoperability Test Event registration fee for non-vendor members is now $350 per person. Test Event registration fees for vendor members and for non-members remain unchanged at $1795 and $2795 respectively for the first two participants, and $150 per additional participant.
