== CalConnect Leadership Changes to Board of Directors and Steering Committee

Posted August 9, 2012

CalConnect announces new members on its Board of Directors, and on its Steering
Committee (charged with the technical direction of the consortium).

On the Board of Directors, Ciny Joy (Oracle) and Scott Mace (HealthLeaders
Media) join Gary Schwartz (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), Pam Taylor
(Sterling Commerce) and Dave Thewlis (DCTA Inc.). Mr. Mace is also known as the
author of http://calendarswamp.blogspot.com[The Calendar Swamp] blog.

On the Steering Committee, Andrew McMillan (individual member), Carnegie Mellon
University, Intand, and Kerio Technologies join Apple, Oracle, Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute and the University of California.

CalConnect thanks the members and individuals who are donating their time and
effort to leading and improving CalConnect and enabling it to fulfill its
mission of calendaring and scheduling interoperability. We also thank those
members and individuals who are stepping down from the Board (Kellie Hunter,
People Cube, and Pat Egen, Patricia Egen Consulting) and the Steering Committee
(NASA, Patricia Egen Consulting, PeopleCube, and the University of Wisconsin)
for the time and effort they have devoted to CalConnect.
