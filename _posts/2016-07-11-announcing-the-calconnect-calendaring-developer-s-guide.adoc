== Announcing the CalConnect Calendaring Developer's Guide

CalConnect has recently published its new Calendaring Developer's Guide as a read-only wiki at http://devguide.calconnect.org[].

We have created an initial outline of topics that we expect will be of value, and added content for a subset of them such as creating a simple event, together with examples. At this point we feel the Guide has enough content to be published and useful, but it is still incomplete.

We encourage all interested parties from both CalConnect participants and the calendaring public to help provide content. There is information on the Developer's Guide on how to contribute.

Please take a look and consider helping in this effort, and we hope that the Guide is useful to you both now and more so in the future.
