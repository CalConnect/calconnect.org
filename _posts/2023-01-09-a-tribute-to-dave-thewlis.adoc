In November 2004, Esther Dyson posted this photo to Flickr, with a
caption of _“Father Time managing his calendar?”_ adding, _“Well, sort
of. This is Dave Thewlis, executive director of CalConnect, the
Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium. Coordinating schedules, public and
private, is still a big challenge. The consortium, which will be
launching 2 weeks from now, December 14th, hopes to help.”_

CalConnect was incorporated earlier in 2004 and now, just shy of 18
years after CalConnect Round Table II, the first CalConnect member
meeting, we pay tribute to Dave, on the occasion of his recent
retirement, for his very special contributions as a founder and
Executive Director of the Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium.

In the 1960’s, after a stint in the US Air Force, Dave settled in
Berkeley California, where he was a founder of the Society for Creative
Anachronism, the inspiration for referring to CalConnect member meetings
as “Round Tables”. During his career in IT management at Kaiser
Permanente Health Care, Dave served as Chief Standards Officer for
SHARE, (originally) the IBM Users Group founded in the mid 1950’s.

Through SHARE Dave met Pamela Taylor, and Pat Egen, then co-chair of
IETF CALSCH, a working group developing interoperable standards, who saw
the need for a calendaring and scheduling consortium. In 2003, Pat
recruited Dave to help start the Consortium, and to serve as Executive
Director. Pam, Pat, and Dave were the founding board members, and each
were awarded the CalConnect Distinguished Service Award. Their
experiences at SHARE and IETF greatly influenced the structure and
practices of CalConnect.

Dave Thewlis’ organizational and administrative contributions to
CalConnect over these last 18 years, is truly immeasurable.

Fostering collaboration among top-tier contributors can be challenging,
but the CalConnect value proposition of creating mutual advantage for
erstwhile competitors through development of open, interoperable C&S
standards in an atmosphere of collegial cooperation is inculcated
throughout the organization. CalConnect is a true meritocracy; anyone,
irrespective of membership category or company affiliation, can become a
CalConnect thought leader, technical leader, or organizational leader,
based on depth of their participation, and the quality of contributions.

Dave’s management persona allowed him to understand the technologists
without competing with them, to achieve consensus through patience and
encouragement to converge on consensus expeditiously, to value the
contributions of all members, to provide the foremost forum to discuss
and debate C&S standards and futures, and to produce standards which
provide value to not only vendors but also to the end-users of their
products. Dave set the tone of civility and cooperation for the
consortium, working tirelessly for the membership, valuing the
contributions of all the members, and fostering an atmosphere
encouraging new and prospective members to feel welcome, and to actively
engage in consortium activities.

CalConnect’s success and longevity are attributable to not only the high
quality of CalConnect’s leadership and membership, but also to:

* CalConnect’s unique approach to developing open, interoperable
standards – discuss, develop “reference” implementations, and test for
practicality, practicability, and interoperability in lockstep with
each other, results in maximally deployable and useful standards.

* CalConnect’s adaptability – technology changes, membership changes,
how business is conducted changes, and the grand (and not so grand)
challenges change. Over the last 17 years CalConnect has changed its
governance, its policies, how it its technical committees conduct
business, the agenda and schedule for member meetings (Round Tables),
its alliances with other organizations, and updated some of its
founding assumptions. In January 2019, after more than a decade
funneling its standards work through the IETF, another standards body,
CalConnect was listed as an official international standards body by the
WTO. CalConnect has added “collaboration” to its extant portfolio of
calendaring and scheduling.

* CalConnect’s engagements in liaison relationships, including The Open
Group, OASIS, NIST, M3AAWG, IETF, several ISO technical committees, and
the Danish government’s ekalendar.DK project. CalConnect created a
Director of External Relationships Board position.

Dave served not only as Executive Director, but also the institutional
memory, the heart and soul of CalConnect. Of the 32 attendees at
Roundtable II in 2005, only Dave and Mike Douglass are still
participants, making it very fitting that Mike succeeds Dave as
CalConnect’s 2nd Executive Director. CalConnect will continue to
flourish, building on the strong foundation Dave put in place.

Ester Dyson’s photo of Dave was captioned “Father Time managing his
calendar?”, but it is likely that any mention of the name “Dave Thewlis”
will conjure up this iconic look for CalConnect Round Table attendees:

Dave Thewlis, together with the late Pat Egen, were the driving force
for the establishment of CalConnect, and he has been the bedrock of the
organization since. When I first joined CalConnect as a small software
vendor, Dave was extremely welcoming, and his enthusiasm and encouraging
support helped inspire me to become more involved, and later evangelize
the benefits of CalConnect as I moved on with my career.

My own deep involvement in CalConnect would not have been possible
without Dave's support - his management of logistics for meetings, and
on-going technology discussions was key to our success with important
Calendaring standards, that are now used on 100's millions of devices
around the world. His detailed note taking of our calls was key to
keeping us all on track and moving forward. He was able to contribute
his own experiences to help us shape the work we were doing, by
providing insightful comments.

The in-person, 3-times a year, CalConnect conferences were always a
highlight of my professional life, with a chance to meet everyone and
have more intense sessions of testing and standards design. Dave was
always there managing the meeting and providing the support everyone
needed to accomplish our goals. The whole Calendaring community owes
Dave a great debt of gratitude for all his hard work and contributions
over the years, and I personally offer my sincere thanks for the many
enjoyable times we had.

Dave Thewlis has been an inspiration and role model ever since I met
him at the first CalConnect meeting I attended, in San Francisco. His
ability to juggle multiple tasks, planning and organizing expertise,
deep knowledge in a wide area of topics, calm and composed way of
explaining are all exemplary. His dedication to bring together the
calendaring community and get standards in place, to foster better
interoperability and co-operation has had wide reaching effect.

On a personal level, I am grateful to Dave for all the camaraderie and
the trust he placed in me to rise to the challenge of performing roles
that were new and I was not sure of.

It was an absolute pleasure working with Dave and I am grateful for that
opportunity and his continued friendship.

Standards take a lot of work and a lot of the most thankless work goes
into just bringing people together and getting some momentum. Dave did
that patiently and effectively for years, and really made calendar
standards work happen and then help those standards take root. Thank
you for your strong and lasting impact.
