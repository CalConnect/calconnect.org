== Only 4 weeks to CalConnect XVIII

It is now only 4 weeks to CalConnect XVIII, May 24-28 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh -- and only 2 weeks until Early Registration (for the Roundtable) ends on the 9th. As of Monday the 10th the registration fee will increase from $350 to $395.

As usual, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning will be the Interoperability Test Events, while Wednesday afternoon to Friday afternoon will be the Roundtable. Remember you must register separately for the two events.

The logistics page (see below) contains the actual schedule of sessions for Roundtable XVIII and will be updated shortly with Topical Agendas for the sessions.

Note that the Interoperability Test Events will include both a regular IOP Test Event and a Mobile Calendaring IOP Test Event focused on ActiveSync. The Mobile Calendaring Test Event is the one that was originally scheduled for February.
