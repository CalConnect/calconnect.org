== CalConnect XLVII Rescheduled to June 15-19 2020

The CalConnect XXVII meeting in Nottingham is now rescheduled from April 20-24 to the week of June 15-19 2020. All other arrangements (host, venue, conference hotel) remain unchanged. The Board has reached this decision after reviewing the current status of COVID-19, as available from the WHO and CDC.

As the situation worldwide with respect to the virus is changing rapidly, please note that we might have to reschedule again to the September/October timeframe. We will issue an update no later than mid-April as to our status.

We recommend that those planning to attend the Nottingham meeting avoid non-changeable travel arrangements, at least until after our further update in mid-April. You can of course still register for the meeting, and can defer registration payment until the meeting.

Our apologies for the inconvenience and uncertainty. We hope the Nottingham meeting in June will proceed apace.
