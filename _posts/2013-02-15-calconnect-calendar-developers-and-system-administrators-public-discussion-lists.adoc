The Calendaring and Scheduling Admin Mailing List (mailto:caladmin-l@lists.calconnect.org[caladmin-l@lists.calconnect.org]) exists to foster discussion about all aspects of calendaring and scheduling system administration and management. This includes, but is not limited to, C&S platforms and applications, emerging C&S standards, message flows, access control, unsolicited or bulk agenda invitations (SPCAL), account management, virus vectors, disaster recovery, and interactions with closely related collaborative technologies.
