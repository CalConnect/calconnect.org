== Workshop on Veterans Administration Scheduling System at CalConnect XXX on May 21, 2014 -- Agenda & Participants

CalConnect was founded almost 10 years ago as a collaboration between calendaring and scheduling vendors and users, to further interoperability between calendaring and scheduling implementations, and work towards this purpose by driving the evolution of calendaring and scheduling standards through technical committee work, holding regular interoperability testing events, and hosting regular conferences, workshops and symposia focused on calendaring and scheduling.

We are using the recent VA Scheduling System Contest as a jump point to explore importance of open calendaring & scheduling standards with respect to healthcare IT, and what changes/additions to these same standards would facilitate healthcare IT for patients, providers, and software developers.

Please note that this information is current as of Monday 12 May 2014. We expect that there may be additions and changes to the participant list and possibly to the presenters or panelists.

The workshop is open to the public by advance registration. To register please see link:{{'/workshopreg' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Workshop Registration]. Lunch will be served at 1230; the CalConnect Conference will open at 13:30 and the workshop will begin at 14:15 as noted below. For more information about the location and other details please see link:{{'/calconnect30' | relative_url}}[CalConnect Conference].

*Agenda and Schedule (Workshop Only)*

1415-1530 Workshop on VA Scheduling System: Part 1  Presentations

1415--1430 Gary Schwartz Welcome and Contextualizing the workshop

1430--1450 Wes Turner Intro to Vista and OSEHRA's role in the VA Scheduling contest

1450--1530 Dr. William Smith Intro to Medred; How+why they got involved in the VA Scheduling Contest; the Health e-Time contest entry

1530-1600 Break and Refreshments

1600-1800 Workshop on VA Scheduling System: Part 2  Panel Discussion

*Panelists*  Dr. William Smith (Medred); Mike Henderson (OSEHRA); William Cox (Cox Software Architects); Toby Considine (TC9); Ken Rubin (HP Enterprise Services); Doug Golub (MediSked); Wilfredo SÃ¡nchez Vega (CalConnect)

*Moderator*  Scott Mace (CalConnect director, Senior Editor  Technology at HealthLeaders Media)

The purpose of the panel discussion is to engage the CalConnect membership with the panelists in a meaningful discussion of healthcare scheduling needs and requirements in the context of calendaring and scheduling standards and interoperability. Out of this discussion we are hoping to learn, at a functional level, what does Healthcare have today in C&S, and what does HealthCare need in C&S that they do not have today, and what Healthcare will need tomorrow.

In turn, out of that discussion should come better understanding, and hopefully some C&S collaborations between CalConnect members, CalConnect TC s, and the Healthcare industry. In particular we hope to identify needs well enough to determine whether to initiate work in this area, and hopefully additional organizations to participate in the work and in CalConnect.

1800-2000 Welcome Reception

The scheduling of the reception immediately after the Workshop is not accidental. It is intended as an informal, and more social opportunity to continue the engaged interaction and participation we anticipate that the Workshop will engender. We are investigating the options for demos of recent CalConnect work in scheduling.
