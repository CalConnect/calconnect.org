== Only 4 weeks to CalConnect XVII

It is now only 4 weeks (28 days) to CalConnect XVII, February 1-5 at the University of California at Irvine, and only 12 days until Early Registration (for the Roundtable) ends on the 15th. After that the registration fee will increase from $350 to $395.

As usual, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning will be the Interoperability Test Event, while Wednesday afternoon to Friday afternoon will be the Roundtable. Remember you must register separately for the two events.

The logistics page (see below) will be updated shortly with the actual schedule for Technical Committee sessions and with Topical Agendas for the sessions.

This Interoperability Test Event will actually be comprised of both a regular IOP Test Event (we expect to be doing CardDAV testing in addition to iCalendar and CalDAV testing) and a Mobile Calendaring IOP Test Event primarily focused on calendaring via synchronization (ActiveSync and SyncML).

Please see link:{{'/calconnect17' | relative_url}} for logistics and planning information, plus link:{{'/regtypes' | relative_url}}[registration links]. For more information specifically about the Mobile Interop including the testing schedule, see link:{{'/miop1002' | relative_url}}[].
