== CalConnect XLVII Rescheduled to October 12-16, 2020

The CalConnect XXVII meeting in Nottingham is now rescheduled again, from June
2020 to October 12-16, 2020. All other arrangements (host, venue, conference
hotel) remain unchanged. The Board has reached this decision after reviewing the
current status of the pandemic, as available from the WHO and CDC, and concluded
that the chance of having a successful in-person conference in June is very
slim.

We recommend that those planning to attend the Nottingham meeting avoid
non-changeable travel arrangements until we can confirm the meeting will be held
in October. You can of course still register for the meeting, and can defer
registration payment until the meeting.

Our apologies for the inconvenience and uncertainty. We hope the Nottingham
meeting in October will proceed apace.
