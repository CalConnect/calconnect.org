== TC CALSPAM - New Technical Committee on Calendar Spam

CalConnect has established a new Technical Committee on Calendar Spam, TC CALSPAM.

The goal of this TC is to better protect users from receiving undesired information delivered through calendar systems, which currently range from spam to phishing attacks. The TC aims to understand the current and potential usage of calendar systems as a vector for delivering undesired information; devise measures and best practices for developers and operators of those systems to ensure legitimate usage. The TC works together with M3AAWG through CalConnect's liaison relationship on the subject of calendar spam.
