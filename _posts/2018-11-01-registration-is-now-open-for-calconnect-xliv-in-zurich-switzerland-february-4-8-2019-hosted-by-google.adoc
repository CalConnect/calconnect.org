Posted November 1, 2018 

The CalConnect XLIV web page is located at link://events/calconnect-xliv-february-4-8-2019 and contains lodging information, airport and transfer information, meeting venue, schedule, etc.&nbsp; The page also offers preliminary information about an https://www.eventbrite.com/e/calendar-and-scheduling-developer-day-zurich-tickets-51512514317[Open Codefest] on Monday 4 February and a https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eu-dst-timezone-change-public-workshop-tickets-51513763052[Public Workshop on Time Zones] on Tuesday afternoon 5 February,

The&nbsp; *meeting venue* is in Building H, part of the Google facilities in central ZÃ¼rich near the central Train Station.&nbsp; The conference hotel is the http://www.25hours-hotels.com/en/hotels/zurich/langstrasse[25hours Hotel Langstrasse], a very short walk from the Central Train Station and across the street from our meeting venue.&nbsp; Three other hotels are also referenced in the link://events/calconnect-xliv-february-4-8-2019#lodging[Lodging] section of the web page.&nbsp; All hotels may be booked immediately.&nbsp; A map of the central area is linked from the link://events/calconnect-xliv-february-4-8-2019#location[Location] section of the web page.

*link://events/calconnect-xliv-february-4-8-2019[CalConnect XLIV]* follows the new conference format which was trialed at our last event in Karlsruhe.&nbsp;&nbsp; CalConnect XLIV itself will be four days (Tuesday through Friday), and brings together, as a single event and with a single fee, our traditional conference and technical sessions.&nbsp; Note that the "track" organization at the September 2018 event will not be used; we will organize sessions for best fit and relevance.

Please see the introduction on the link://events/calconnect-xliv-february-4-8-2019[CalConnect XLIV web page] for a fuller description of the event and information about the Open Codefest and the Time Zone Workshop.

The schedule for the four days is currently under development and will be posted in the link://events/calconnect-xliv-february-4-8-2019#conference-schedule[CalConnect XLIV Schedule] as we get closer to the event, so please check periodically.&nbsp;

Fees and Registration Options:&nbsp; The registration fee for the full four-day event is $950 (late registration is $1050).&nbsp; We are also offering a trial one-day registration fee of $400 (late registration $475).&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration information is at https://www.calconnect.org/events/event-registration-payment and is linked from the event web page.&nbsp;

As always, please let us know if you have any questions.
