A general schedule is posted, but will be updated nearer to the event with the actual session schedule and with topical agendas for the schedule.

The meeting venue is on the Oracle campus at 4040 Palm Drive, Santa Clara, California.

The exact schedule for TC Sessions is not yet fixed but should be determined by the beginning of January.

Early registration for the Roundtable will be $350 through 11 January, 2013, and $395 after that date. See link:{{'/regtypes' | relative_url}}[Registration Information] for registration forms. Please note that the early registration about applies so long as you register <= 11 January, even if you don't actually pay until the event.
