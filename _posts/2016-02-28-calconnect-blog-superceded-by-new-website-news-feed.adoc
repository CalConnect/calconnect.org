== CalConnect Blog Superceded by New Website News Feed

Posted February 28, 2016

We have superceded our old blog, calconnect.wordpress.com, with the news feed from our new website, link:{{'/news' | relative_url}}[www.calconnect.org/news]. We've also put a redirect in on the old blog site so anyone with a bookmark to the old blog will wind up on the new news feed. In the process, virtually all of the old blog entries have been ported into the new site so you can still reference old blog entries.
