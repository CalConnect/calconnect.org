Another reason to register early: you won t forget and miss the early registration deadline. Please note that the early registration about applies so long as you register <= 17 May, even if you don't actually pay until the event.

*About the Interoperability Test Event:*

The information page for the Interoperability Test event is at link:{{'/iop1306' | relative_url}}[IOP 1306]. Please see this page for the current list of areas we plan to test; it will be updated regularly as testing registrations and requests are received. In addition, participants may have other areas they wish to test and we will be happy to include them in our planning; the test event registration form provides a place to indicate what you want to test. n all cases at least two participating organizations must be interested in testing a particular area or scenario to form testing pairs.
