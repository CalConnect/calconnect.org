== Registration is open for CalConnect XXXIV in Amsterdam 28 September -- 2 October 2015

Registration is now open and hotel reservations may be made for CalConnect XXXIV in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Sep 28  Oct 2 2015, hosted by Gershon Janssen.

The CalConnect XXXIV web page is located at link:{{'/calconnect34' | relative_url}}[/calconnect34] and contains hotel information and booking, airport and transfer information, meeting venue, international travel information, etc.

The conference hotel is The Motel One Amsterdam-RAI which is brand new (it opens in mid August) and doesn't have a web page yet. Our host, Gershon Janssen, has arranged a special room rate of about â‚¬110 per night at the hotel (this is an average for a single room; prices Sunday-Tuesday are much higher than Wednesday-Friday). We have a room block of 20 rooms which will expire 1 September after which no guarantees of price or availability.

The hotel is about 800 meters from the venue, http://www.rosarium.net/[The Rosarium Amsterdam]. We will be at the Rosarium for the entire week.

Please note that, to obtain the special CalConnect rate, you cannot book online; the event web page offers an e-mail address or a telephone number which you may contact to request a booking, referring to the "`CalConnect`" group code. The hotel will call back as needed or e-mail you to confirm particulars including a credit card if you wish to guarantee the booking.

If you wish to make alternative hotel arrangements, please be aware that due to a large medical convention in the same area of Amsterdam the same week. hotel rooms are pretty limited, and it would be wise to book as soon as possible.

A schedule and conference program is posted on the CalConnext XXXIV link:{{'/calconnect34#schedule' | relative_url}}[web page]. The interoperability test event will take place Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning, as usual; the Conference will be Wednesday afternoon through Friday. Our format will follow that of our last meeting: most Conference sessions will be higher-level strategy and cross-TC, with some specific very detailed discussions held during break-outs in the interoperability test event. We expect that the schedule and program will evolve over time, so check the web page periodically.

Hope to see you in Amsterdam for CalConnect XXXIV; please contact us with any questions.
