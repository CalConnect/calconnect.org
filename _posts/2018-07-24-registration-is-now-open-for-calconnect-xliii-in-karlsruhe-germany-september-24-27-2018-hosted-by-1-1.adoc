This event is the first preview of our new conference format. CalConnect XLIII will be four days (Monday through Thursday), and brings together, as a single event and with a single fee, our traditional conference (Conference Track), with elements of the former developers' forum (Technical Track). The two tracks are simply a handy guide to the session content, and all attendees are encouraged to attend sessions in both tracks. We will use your feedback and experience at Karlsruhe to help us fine-tune our new conference for events in 2019 and beyond.

Please see the introduction on the event web page linked above for a fuller description of what the event will look lie.

The schedule for the four days is available on the event web page at link:{{'/events/calconnect-xliii-september-2018#conference-schedule' | relative_url}}[]. We do expect that the schedule will evolve as we get closer to the event, so please check periodically.

Fees and Registration Options: The registration fee for the full four-day event is $800 (late registration is $900. We are also offering a trial one-day registration fee of $300 (late registration $375).

As always, please let me know if you have any questions.

See you in Karlsruhe!
