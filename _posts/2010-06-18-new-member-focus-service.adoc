== New Member Focus Service

CalConnect is expanding the Member News service on our blog. The addition is a Member Focus service -- a short introduction on the blog to a specific CalConnect member. It will include links to more information about the member, and possibly a significant press release or set of releases about a topic of interest to our members.

As with Member News, the Member Focus service will be calendaring-related. In the case of some of our members, that is very easy to do. In other cases, such as academic members or large vendors with a suite of offerings, the short piece will highlight the member's tools or services related to calendaring.

The intent is for the introduction posted on the blog to be quite short -- no more than a paragraph or two at most -- but provocative enough to interest someone to click through.
