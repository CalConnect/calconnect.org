== CalConnect's fifth European event is this spring! You're invited to join us in Bucharest, Romania, at 1and1, May 18-22, 2015

Our previous European conferences, in 2011, 2013 and 2014, were very successful. In the past we ve come to Europe in the autumn, but we re coming early. link:{{'/calconnect33' | relative_url}}[CalConnect XXXIII] will take place in Bucharest, Romania, on May 18-22, 2015, hosted by http://1und1.de/[1and1].

We encourage our European colleagues and others interested in Calendaring and Scheduling to join us. We re working to make this event as attractive as possible to organizations that are not currently members but have thought about exploring CalConnect, and a European event is a chance for people to participate in a CalConnect event without having to incur the travel costs and time of coming to North America.

CalConnect is a collaboration between calendaring and scheduling vendors and users. It was established to further interoperability between calendaring and scheduling implementations, and works towards this purpose by driving the evolution of calendaring and scheduling standards through technical committee work, holding regular interoperability testing events, and hosting regular conferences, workshops and symposia focused on calendaring and scheduling.

European companies were among CalConnect's earliest members, and as standards and interoperability are both central to CalConnect's mission and are strong core values of European Information Technology, we have long recognized the importance of increasing European involvement in CalConnect. To that end we held special events in Europe in 2007 and 2008 in preparation for our first regular CalConnect conference in Europe in 2011. This spring's event in Bucharest is one which we hope will continue with even greater European participation in CalConnect's interoperable calendaring and scheduling efforts, and we applaud the increased involvement by Europeans in our technical activities over the last few years.

The exact testing scenarios will be decided based on who is coming and what (and with whom) they want to test. Specific new testing areas include:

VTODO extensions for Tasks +
Calendar extensions +
COLOR +
STRUCTURED-LOCATION etc +
