== Update: CalDAV Support for Symbian

Posted February 26, 2010

See http://blog.symbian.org/2010/02/25/%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFcaldav-support-for-symbian-a-contribution-by-sun-microsystems/[].

The CalDAV contribution by Sun Microsystems (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle) is now integrated in Symbian^3. This means that any manufacturer releasing a handset based on the current and any upcoming Symbian version will be able to make use of this great addition to the platform.
