*Only four weeks left until CalConnect XXXVI in Hong Kong, April 18-22, 2016, hosted by Ribose and OGCIO*

If you are planning to come to Hong Kong *it's time to register*! And to book
your flights and hotel. The CalConnect XXXVI web page is located at

contains hotel information and booking, airport and transfer information,
meeting venue, international travel information, etc. In additon to information

optional tours on Saturday after the event. The conference hotel is LÃ© Meridien
Cyberport, located at our meeting venue for the week. The hotel is offering a
special CalConnect rate. A special CalConnect rate is also being offered by two
hotels in central Hong Kong, and there are also links on the web page to a few
other hotels which are somewhat nearer to the Cyberport than central.

We will be at the meeting venue at the Cyberport for the interoperability test
event Monday and Tuesday, and the conference Thursday and Friday. Wednesday we
are hosting a Public Day at the Convention Centre as part of the Hong Kong
ITFEST. More information about all aspects of this event including the Public
Day is located on our web page for the event.

Hope to see you in Hong Kong for CalCOnnect XXXVI. As always, contact us at
