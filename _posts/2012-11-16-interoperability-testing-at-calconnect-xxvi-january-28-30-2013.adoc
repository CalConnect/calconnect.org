== Interoperability Testing at CalConnect XXVI, January 28-30, 2013

The Interoperability Test Event will take place all day Monday and Tuesday, January 28-29, and Wednesday morning January 30th during CalConnect XXVI, hosted by Oracle in Santa Clara, California. For information about event logistics please see link:{{'/calconnect26' | relative_url}}[].

At this point we are planning testing in the following areas (Updated 30 November 2012):

* CalDAV testing:


** access (basic operations of CalDAV)
** scheduling
** sync report
** mobile
** managed attachments
** sharing
* iSchedule:


** Server discovery
** DKIM security  latest changes for header normalization
* Timezone:


** Service Protocol (new JSON spec)
** Timezones by Reference
* VPOLL initial testing
* Autodiscovery protocol
* iCalendar:


** richtext properties (and hashing)
** iTIP/iMIP
** jCal, the JSON Format for iCalendar
** xCal, the XML Format for iCalendar
* CardDAV testing:


** generic
** Sync report
** mobile
** vcard 4?
* CalWS-REST and CalWS-SOAP, the web services protocols for iCalendar and WS-Calendar

In addition, participants may have other areas they wish to test and we will be happy to include them in our planning; the test event registration form provides a place to indicate what you want to test. In all cases at least two participating organizations must be interested in testing a particular area or scenario to form testing pairs.

Your organization need not be a member of CalConnect to participate in an Interoperability Test Event.
