This page is a "cold call" to ask you to consider joining CalConnect. As
you have already found your way to this web page, we think there is a
very good chance that your organization and CalConnect would both
benefit from your active participation as a member.

In a nutshell, CalConnect's focus is interoperable calendaring and
scheduling and related areas. Through promoting, advising, educating,
and the work of our technical committees, we advance the state of
interoperable calendaring and of interoperable scheduling, together with
areas such as date and time management, digital addressing, etc.

We are a partnership between vendors of calendaring & scheduling systems
and tools, and users of those tools. Our membership includes some of the
world's largest software development organizations, as well as emergent
vendors and startups, end user organizations, interested individuals,
and research universities. Our members believe that through the
collegial interactions and collaborations among erstwhile competitors in
the marketplace, everybody wins. Interoperability makes good products
great products, and expands the market for these great products.

CalConnect is a 501(c)6 tax-exempt mutual benefit association
incorporated in 2004. We are a member-driven organization â€“ the agenda,
the projects undertaken, the collaborations with other organizations,
all result from the work of  our TCs - technical committees, which are
made up of and led by participants from our member organizations.

Although the original C&S standards are IETF RFCs, most of the
calendaring and scheduling standards development and discussion in the
last ten years have taken place in CalConnect. We maintain
link:{{'/about/liaisons-and-relationships' | relative_url }}[active liaisons]
with a number of ISO/IEC Technical Committees and other standards
entities. In addition to our own standards, we are working with several
ISO Technical Committees on joint projects and anticipate co-publication
of standards in the future.   We have collaborated and cooperated with
the IETF and OASIS on CalDAV, RFC 5545 (iCalendar bis), iSchedule,
calendaring web services, XML and JSON representations of iCalendar,
timezone services, vCard 4.0 and CardDAV, to list some of our most
recent work.

In addition to regular technical conferences each year, from time to
time we hold workshops to bring together the CalConnect membership and
other leading experts to explore specific technical areas, such as vCard
and timezones.

We know how hard it is to sell you "cold", so, instead, we would like to
help you sell yourself. Take a look at CalConnect, especially:

* Our link:{{'/news' | relative_url }}[achievements and our story]

CalConnect's success, and ultimately the success of our vision of
interoperable calendaring depend on broad, engaged, diverse, and
informed participation by those organizations developing calendaring and
scheduling products, and those organizations which are using calendaring
and scheduling products.

In short, if you are trying to solve a problem, find a solution, build a
product, help drive the standards, or simply get to know the people
driving calendaring & scheduling today, CalConnect is the organization
at the center of calendaring & scheduling today.

=== Take CalConnect for a Test Drive

You can attend one CalConnect Conference as an observer, without having yet
become a member. Refer to link:{{'/events/observers' | relative_url }}[observers] for additional
details on the terms and conditions for observer participation.  In conjunction
with our Conferences, we offer on-site Interoperability testing with other
implementers.
