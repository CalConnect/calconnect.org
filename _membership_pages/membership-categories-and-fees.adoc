_Revised 18 October 2021_

The membership fee varies by the type of organization applying for
membership. Membership fees are due annually upon the organization's
anniversary of joining CalConnect. (An organization joins CalConnect
upon our receipt and acceptance of its membership application, generally
within 1-2 days of application submittal.)

All new members receive a 50% discount on their first year's membership
dues, and a 50% discount on all event fees during their first membership
year. +
